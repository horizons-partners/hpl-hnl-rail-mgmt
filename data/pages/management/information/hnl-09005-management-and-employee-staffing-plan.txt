===== 2 HRH Organization Overview =====

The O&M organization structure and design is vital for the overall performance of HRH. To meet the requirements of HART, HRH has taken the following factors into consideration:

  * Best Practices in organization design by major driverless transit systems operated by HRH;

  * The workflow process and relationship between systems, functions and tasks; and

  * The need for all work units to coordinate, cooperate and interface seamlessly to provide safe, reliable and quality service.

The HRH IOMP Organization will be led by the O&M Director. The organization is divided into the five departments:

1) Contracts and Corporate Services

2) HSEQ

3) O&M Readiness

4) Operations

5) Engineering & Maintenance

This organizational model was chosen to provide clear lines of responsibility for corporate services and contract management, operational readiness, safety, operations and customer service and engineering and maintenance. The Corporate Services Department is headed by a senior manager who is responsible for coordinating with the various Hitachi Rail Corporate Services organization on a wide range of services including HR Finance, Procurement, Legal etc. This structure is considered suitable for start-up organizations where there is a low level of cross-skilling.
