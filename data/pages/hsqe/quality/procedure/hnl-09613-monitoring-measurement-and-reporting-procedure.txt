==== 1.5 Description of Changes from the Previous Revision ====

Revisions based on HART Comments on Rev 00.00 submittal. Comment review form HNL_09613_53_02_03_046 and HDOT comments review of HNL-09613 Monitoring Measurement and Reporting on Rev 00.00

\\
===== 2 Structure of the KPI Regime =====
Key Performance Indicators allow HRH to: 

  * Monitor whether it is delivering the Passenger Services required by DTS to a high-quality standard; 

  * Identify where there are opportunities to improve the Passenger Services, correct any performance issues and to monitor and review progress once improvements are made; 

  * Monitor whether it is delivering the Passenger Services required by DTS to a safe, secure, and environmentally sustainable standard; 

  * Identify where there are opportunities to improve safety and environmental management in the delivery of the Passenger Services; 

  * Provide quality assurance and continuous improvement through benchmarking and regular review; 

  * Provide a basis for consistent and responsive complaints handling; 

  * Provide information for stakeholders; and 

  * To demonstrate accountability and entitlement for payment. 

  * Reducing Accidents, Incidents and managing Safety Events.

\\
===== 3 Performance Measurement =====

==== 3.1 Measurement Methods ====

The different methods to measure Performance KPI are:

  * Direct Performance Measurement: the measure is directly extracted from an electronic system, compiled according to the specific definition of the KPI and checked for consistency with contextual information and identify events beyond the control of the operator;

  * Records from a Computerized Maintenance Management System: the measure is the result of a query from a Computerized Maintenance Management System; and

  * Surveys: are either conducted according to a predetermined questionnaire by DTS, an independent surveyor (enquiring openly or as a “mystery shopper”), HRH inspection team or a joint team between DTS and HRH.

\\
==== 3.2 Internal Performance Measurement ====

In addition to the Contractual KPI’s, HRH management have developed a preliminary set of KPI’s to assess the performance of day-to-day activities in every field and ensure the achievement of DTS’s KPI’s as well as HRH’s HSEQ objectives.

Details of HRH’s internal Performance Measurement KPI’s are contained in ‎Annex A

\\
==== 3.3 Contractual Performance Measurement ====

Contractual Performance is measured in terms of the following performance factors:

\\
=== 3.3.1	Vehicle Miles ===

The number of incremental vehicle miles, if any, operated below or above the baseline vehicle miles based on the applicable Baseline Service levels.

\\
=== 3.3.2	System Service Availability ===

System Service Availability will be determined by means of a specific calculator interfaced with Core Systems. The System service Availability Factor is made up of the following:

\\
== 3.3.2.1	Service Mode Availability ==
 
Determined as the ratio between:

  * Actual Mode Hours - The total time, in hours, that the System is scheduled to provide passenger service in the specific operating mode minus the total time, in hours, of all mode downtime events occurring while the System is scheduled to provide service in the specific operating mode; 

  * Scheduled Mode Operating Hours - The amount of time recorded in hours for which a specific operational mode of service is scheduled to be provided; and

\\
== 3.3.2.2	Fleet Availability ==
 
Determined as the ratio between:

  * Actual Vehicle Hours - the product of the actual number of Fully Functional Vehicles provided in the specific operating mode, and the time, in hours, during which that operating mode and those vehicles operate, minus all vehicle downtime; and

  * Scheduled Vehicle Hours - the product of the total number of vehicles required for the specific operating mode and the time, in hours, scheduled for that mode.

\\
== 3.3.2.3	Station Platform Screen Automatic Gate Availability ==

Determined as the ratio between:

  * Actual Platform Screen Automatic Gate Hours - the product of the scheduled number of station platform screen automatic gates operated on the System, and the time, in hours, of the specific operating mode, minus the total time of all Platform Screen Automatic Gate Downtime Events; and

  * Scheduled Platform Screen Automatic Gate Hours - the product of the scheduled number of platform screen automatic gates required to be operable and the time, in hours, for the specific operating mode.

\\
=== 3.3.3	Cleaning and ROC Maintenance Factor ===

A factor of the cleaning and ROC maintenance tasks not being performed to the standards and frequencies specified in the contract.

\\
===== 4 Performance Reporting =====

==== 4.1 Internal Performance Reporting ====

The following reports shall be prepared for internal performance management purposes:

^ Frequency ^ Report ^ Timescale ^
