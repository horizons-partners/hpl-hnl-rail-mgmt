The objective of the yearly audit program is to give evidence to the Management that HRH’s activities are under control. This means that practices are compliant with the IMS and with HRH objectives. The audit program permits to identify discrepancies and to propose improvements, where needed.

The main following criteria are taken into account for the creation of the audit programs:

  * Risks

  * Critical products and services

  * Auditors do not audit their own work

=== 3.2.2	Second Party Audits ===

Second party audits can be requested at any time by a Head of Department or Manager.

Requests must be e-mailed to the Risk and Quality Specialist, who upon receipt will meet with the requestor and agree the audit team, audit scope, and proposed date.

Second party audits will follow the process detailed in Section ‎5, with any corrective actions being assigned to the Contract Manager/Procurement Manager as the owner, and who will follow up the actions with the auditee.

Follow up audits may be carried out where necessary at the discretion of the auditor.

\\
3.2.3	Third Party Audits (performed by Customers, partners and third parties)=== 
 ===
The external audits performed by Customers, partners and third parties are carried out by audit teams that apply rules, tools and methodology defined into their own quality management systems (certification bodies, customers, partners...).

External third party audits may be self-imposed (Management System Certification Audits) or imposed on HRH by the Employer and/or regulator.

In the first instance, such third-Party organizations shall co-ordinate with the Risk and Quality Specialist, from there they will be assigned a point of contact within HRH.

Dates for the Third-Party Audit will be agreed in advance by the auditing organization and the point of contact. The point of contact is responsible for all internal communication and planning for the audit.

Actions arising from the audit must be discussed and agreed with the auditee responsible for the area being audited.

Copies of the Third-Party Audit report will be circulated to the Directors, relevant Departmental Manager, the person assigned the corrective action and the Risk and Quality Specialist.

The nonconformities identified during external audits performed by Customers, partners and third parties should be internally managed by applying the requirements defined in HNL-09623 Management of Hazards and Non-Conformances.

\\

==== 5.1 Overview ====

Internal (First Party) Audits and Second Party Audits undertaken by HRH shall be conducted as per Figure 2.
 
[{{:hsqe:quality:procedure:hnl-09616:hnl-09616-f02.png?600|Figure 2 - Internal Audits and Second Party Audits Performance}}]

==== 5.2 Initial Contacts with the Auditees ====

The initial contact with the auditees for the performance of the audit can be informal (internal audits) or formal (external providers audits performed by HRH) and shall be made by the audit team leader.

\\
==== 5.3 Audit Plan Preparation and Agreement ====

For each audit (both internal and external), an audit plan shall be developed by the audit team leader, supported by the audit team. The plan shall be documented in a standard form.

HNL-09617 Internal Audit Report Template shall be used for all audits types and scopes.

The audit plan shall take into account at least the following information (when applicable):

  * Results of previous audits performed

  * Results of audits performed by HRH Internal Audit and Customers

  * Risks

  * Nonconformities

  * Complaints

The audit plan shall include the scheduling of the audit which shall be agreed between the audit team leader and the auditees.

==== 5.4 Audit Check List Preparation ====

One or more audit check lists can be prepared by the audit team using HNL-09617 Internal Audit Report Template.

Each question included in the check lists shall be linked to a requirement deriving from standards, laws, contracts or IMS documents.

The audit check list can be tailored to suit the audit needs.

The audit check list could be shared before the audit performance with the auditees if requested by them.

\\

The opening meeting should be held with the auditee’s management and, where appropriate, those responsible for the functions or processes to be audited.

\\
==== 5.6 Collection of Evidence and Generation of Findings ====

During the audit the audit team shall record the evidences collected through interviews and observations.

Only information that is verifiable should be accepted as audit evidences.

The auditors should follow the check lists prepared for the audit but they can skip or add questions depending on the audit progress.

Audit evidence shall be evaluated against the audit criteria in order to determine audit findings. Audit findings can indicate conformity or nonconformity with audit criteria.

When one auditor identifies a potential nonconformity, he/she shall immediately inform the auditee.

The audit team shall meet as needed to review the audit findings at appropriate stages during the audit.

\\
==== 5.7 Preparation of the Audit Report ====

Collected data shall be documented in an audit report, using [[hsqe:quality:form:hnl-09617-internal-audit-report-template|HNL-09617]] Internal Audit Report Template, based on the following general provisions:

  * Findings/observations synthesis, stated clearly and concisely

  * Strengths and weak points identification and any suggestions for improvement

  * Identification of major and minor nonconformities

  * Nonconformities and their supporting audit evidence shall be recorded

  * Nonconformities shall be considered as:\\ o	Major nonconformities when the unfulfilled requirement is relevant to a standard or a law\\ o	Minor nonconformities when the unfulfilled requirement is relevant to a contract or an IMS document

The nonconformities shall be reviewed with the auditees in order to obtain acknowledgement that the audit evidence is accurate, and that the nonconformities are understood. Every attempt shall be made to resolve any diverging opinions concerning the audit evidence or findings, and unresolved points shall be recorded.

For each audit conducted, the audit report described will consist of Audit Findings categorized on severity of the non-compliance. These may be listed as ‘Findings’, ‘Recommendations’, and ‘Observations’. Each Non-Conformance of a ‘Finding’ or ‘Recommendation’ will have a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) associated with it.  Each Observation will require a Preventive Action.

\\
==== 5.8 Approval of Internal Audit Reports ====

The draft report shall be sent to the approver, in order to check the level of potential nonconformities identified by the audit team. A review by the approver shall verify the adequacy of the audit coverage, summary of the findings or observations and preliminary versions of the nonconformities. This review can be conducted either with the audit team in a structured meeting or virtually.

The Audit report is signed both by the Audit Team Leader and the involved audit approver.

\\
==== 5.9 Closing Meeting ====

A closing meeting, facilitated by the audit team leader, shall be held to present the audit findings and conclusions.

Participants in the closing meeting should include the management of the auditee and, where appropriate, those responsible for the functions or processes which have been audited.

\\
==== 5.10 Non-Conformity Management ====

=== 5.10.1	Non-Conformity Recording ===

Non-conformities have to be recorded into AudiTool, or Intelex, or CSA&C SharePoint site, and managed as defined in PRC 045.

Improvement plans should be requested when, e.g.:

  * It is possible to implement a best practice

  * A potential nonconformity has been identified

For each nonconformity and improvement plan the following actions shall be performed:

  * Take action to control and correct it, as applicable

  * Identify the Person Responsible to follow-up the actions defined within the plan

  * Determine the causes of the nonconformity

  * Evaluate the need for action to mitigate or eliminate the causes of the nonconformity

  * Perform the corrective actions to prevent the recurrence, if they have been considered needed

  * Evaluate of the effectiveness of the corrective action, if they have been considered needed 

\\
=== 5.10.2	Non-Conformity Coding ===

Nonconformities/improvement plans related to quality and system safety audits are referenced by:
  * The audit identification (XX_YY_NNN)

  * The kind of action plan, nonconformity (CAR) or improvement plan (IPL)

  * One sequential three digits number (NNN)

Nonconformities / improvement plans related to HSE audits are loaded into the Intelex tool and the encoding is automatic.

\\
