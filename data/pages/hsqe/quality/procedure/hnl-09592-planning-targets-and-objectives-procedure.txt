==== 2	Actions to address risks and opportunities ====

HRH considers risks and opportunities when taking actions within the management system, as well as when implementing or improving the management system; likewise, these are considered relative to products and services. Risks and opportunities are identified throughout all activities of the HSQE Management System.
Risks and opportunities are managed in accordance with PRC 016 Bidding and Business Project Risk Management. This procedure defines how Project risks are managed in order to minimize their likelihood and impact, and how opportunities are managed to improve their likelihood and benefit. 
PRC-016 is supported by individual procedures for Workplace / Task risks to employees (HNL-09640 Occupational Risk Management), System Risk for rail safety (HNL-09637 System Risk Management) and Environmental Aspects, Impacts, Risks and Opportunities (HNL-09659 Environmental Aspects, Impacts, Risks and Opportunities).

\\

==== 3	HSQE Objectives and planning to achieve them ====

\\

=== 3.1	Alignment to Hitachi Objectives ===

In developing its HSQE Objectives (Improvement Goals), HRH will include those identified within MNL 050 which in turn are aligned to Hitachi global objectives defined in MNL 003.

\\

=== 3.2	HRH Objectives ===

HRH utilizes its process objectives, as defined in the Core Systems Contract with the Employer, as the main objectives for the HRH IMS. These include overall service-related HSQE objectives; additional objectives may be defined in work instructions.

The objectives have been adopted in consideration that they are:

a)	consistent with the safety, quality and environmental policies;

b)	measurable;

c)	take into account applicable requirements;

d)	relevant to conformity of services and to the enhancement of customer satisfaction;

e)	monitored;

f)	communicated;

g)	updated as appropriate.

HSQE objectives are defined in the Core Systems Contract and HNL-09613 Monitoring, Measurement and Reporting Procedure
The planning to achieve HSQE objectives is described in ‎Annex A.
In addition to Process HSQE Objectives HRH sets HSQE improvement goals, also referred to as HSQE Objectives. These Objectives are developed annually and submitted to the HSQE Management Review for approval, progress against them will be tracked and reported on. 
 
\\

==== 4	Operational planning and control ==== 

HRH plans and develops the processes needed for realization of its Services.  Planning of Service realization is consistent with the requirements of the other processes of the HSQE management systems. Such planning considers the information related to the context of the organization, current resources and capabilities, as well as Service requirements.

Such planning is accomplished through:

a)	determining the requirements for the Services;

b)	consider the added-value of the process

c)	establishing criteria for the processes and the acceptance of Services;

d)	determining the resources needed to achieve conformity to the Service requirements;

e)	implementing control of the processes in accordance with the criteria;

f)	determining, maintaining and retaining documented information to the extent necessary to have confidence that the processes have been carried out as planned and to demonstrate the conformity of Services to their requirements.

Changes to operational processes are done in accordance with HNL-09619 Management of Change procedure.

Outsourced processes and the means by which HRH controls them are defined in:

a)	PRD 016 – Procurement

b)	PRC-019 - Sourcing Process Management

c)	PRC-020 - Purchase Request Management

d)	PRC-021 - Purchase Orders Management

e)	PRC-022 - Acceptance of Purchased Products

f)	PRC-023 - Request for Quotation Management

g)	PRC-024 - Supplier Management

h)	PRC-025 - External Provider Qualification

=== A.1 Service Availability ===

^ Definition/Sub-KPI ^ Measures ^
|Product of service Mode Availability, Fleet Availability, Platform Screen Gates Availability. The target is 99.5%, monthly average.| See measures below| 
| Service Mode Availability: ratio between the actual mode hours and scheduled mode hours. The ratio is multiplied by K factor, which represents the quantity of service delivered during partial mode operations (e.g. single tracking). K factors are specified in TP-3 for each degraded mode| Implement, analyze, correct and optimize core systems maintenance program based on field experience. Properly train maintenance staff in maintaining core systems. Train operations staff in properly implementing normal, degraded and emergency work instructions. Dispatching operations staff at each station to ensure quick operation troubleshooting. Ensuring adequate availability of maintenance staff to respond to systems faults.| 
| Fleet Availability: ratio between actual vehicle hours and scheduled vehicle hours| Implement, analyze, correct and optimize train maintenance program based on field data. Properly train maintenance staff in maintaining trains and on board systems. Properly train operations staff in implementing normal, degraded and emergency work instructions.| 
| Platform Screen Gates Availability: ratio between the number of platform screen gate hours operated in the system and the scheduled platform screen gate hours in the system| Implement, analyze, correct and optimize platform screen gates maintenance program based on field data. Properly train maintenance staff in maintaining platform screen gates. Dispatching operations staff at each station to ensure quick operation troubleshooting. Properly train operations staff in implementing normal, degraded and emergency work instructions.|
