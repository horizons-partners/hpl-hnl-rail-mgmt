===== 1 Scope =====
==== 1.1 Purpose ====
The Design-Bulid-Operate-Maintain (DBOM) Core Systems Contract (CSC) requires that Hitachi Rail Honolulu Joint Venture (HRH) establish separate Quality Assurance Plans for the Design-Build portion and the Operate-Maintain portion of the Core Systems. These Quality Assurance Plans (QAPs) are to ensure that the Core Systems being furnished by HRH for the Honolulu Rail Transit Project (HRTP) are designed, procured, constructed, operated and maintained in accordance with established quality requirements. These requirements provide the controls for design, engineering, procurement, construction, inspections, testing, commissioning, operations, and maintenance, in order to ensure that the quality necessary for safe and reliable operation of its entire Rail Transit System is achieved.  

The Quality Assurance Plan (QAP) articulated herein provides general requirements and guidance for the establishment and execution of quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) for the Operations & Maintenance (O&M) of the Honolulu Rail Transit (HRT) System. 

HRH understands that the HRT System will be under joint ownership of Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation (HART) and Honolulu City’s Department of Transportation Services (DTS) during the O&M start-up and transition to revenue service.  HRH also understands that the HRT System will be under full ownership of DTS during revenue servce, which starts with the interim opening of the System from East Kapolei to Aloha Stadium.   Hence, this initial issue of the QAP covers the O&M start-up and transition phases and is subject to review and acceptance by both HART and DTS.  It will be revised and re-issued prior to the interim opening, for DTS review and acceptance.

This QAP intends to meet the requirements of the FTA Quality Assurance (QA)/Quality Control (QC) Guidelines (FTA-IT-90-5001-02.1 February 2002 Issue). The 15 Essential Elements of the FTA QA/QC Guidelines are as follows:

Element 1: Management Responsibility

Element 2: Documented Quality Management System

Element 3: Design Control

Element 4: Document Control

Element 5: Purchasing

Element 6: Product Identification and Traceability

Element 7: Process Control

Element 8: Inspection and Testing

Element 9: Inspection, Measuring, and Test Equipment

Element 10: Inspection and Test Status

Element 11: Nonconformance

Element 12: Corrective Action

Element 13: Quality Records

Element 14: Quality Audits

Element 15: Training

This QAP is also intended to meet the ISO 9001:2008 Quality management systems- Requirements standard, issued by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).  A comparison Matrix between this QAP, the FTA QA/QC Guidelines and the ISO 9001:2008 is shown in Appendix 1.

Microsoft® SharePoint, a web-based content management and document management system available on the HRH Intranet, shall be used for this purpose.  A SharePoint (SP) domain customized for the O&M Organization has been created.  All internal and external correspondence, minutes of meetings, conformed contract documents, internal training materials, community outreach and public relations materials, etc. shall be stored in specific libraries set up in the O&M SP domain. Each of these documents shall be uniquely identifiable by a combination of its title, date of issue, storage location in the library, etc.  There shall be no risk of using a superseded document pulled from a SP library.
