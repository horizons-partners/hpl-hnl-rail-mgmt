If there is a medical emergency or fire, the guard on patrol with the automobile, will drive to the front gate to lead HFD or EMS to the proper location of the incident.

No visitors are allowed in through the gate unless they have a proper ID or are identified by an HRH employee as their visitor.  The person wishing entrance to the ROC must fill out the visitors log and surrender a state ID with their picture.  They are then issued a visitors badge.

includes, but is not limited to any condition exhibited by an individual, or physical injury complaints received from an individual, that would likely require immediate medical attention by trained medical personnel or emergency medical technicians.
Security must ensure that Hitachi Management and Hitachi Staff personnel are notified as quickly as possible. Security will also ensure that access lanes are clear for emergency response personnel and their vehicles.

Security will maintain a written record of events that occur during the emergency. Prepare an Incident Report at the conclusion of emergency situation.
