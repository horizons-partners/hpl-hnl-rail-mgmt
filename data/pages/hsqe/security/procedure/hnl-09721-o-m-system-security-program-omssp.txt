====== 1 Scope ======

===== 1.1	Policy Statement =====

HRH is committed to supporting the DTS System Security Policy.

HRH is committed to providing safe, secure, reliable, efficient and convenient rail transportation services. Safety and security are critical functions that affect all of our activities. Therefore, all HRH employees and contractors are charged with promoting the safety and security of customers, employees and the public through the implementation of this O&M System Security Program.

All HRH employees and contractors are expected to conduct their duties in a safe, secure manner so as to prevent criminal activity and property damage. HRH managers are expected to be leaders in promoting safety and security throughout the organization and to provide authority, support and resources necessary to establish and maintain high standards.

The Director, Operations and Maintenance, as the accountable executive, has empowered the Head of HSE (O&M Chief Safety and Security Officer) to develop, distribute and administer a comprehensive and coordinated OMSSP that is integrated with the DTS System Security Plan. All employees, contractors and contractor operators are governed by the requirements and terms of this OMSSP and must conscientiously learn and follow prescribed security and emergency rules and procedures.  Each employee must operate safely, use equipment, tools and materials properly and be trained in the work rules and procedures for his/her areas of responsibility, including contingency plans for abnormal and emergency conditions.  Each employee shall take an active part in the identification and resolution of security concerns.  

HRH’s overall goals are to maximize the level of security experienced by all passengers, employees, and any other individuals who come into contact with the transportation system, and to minimize the cost associated with the intrusion of vandals and others into the system.

HRH is committed to an environment where open and honest communication and employees are required to bring any conditions perceived to affect security to the HRH Head of Safety. 

HRH and its contractors are committed to this OMSSP because it formalizes security in concert with safety as our transportation system's top priority. 


===== 1.2	Overview =====

This OMSSP established the activities that must be performed by all departments within HRHR to ensure secure operations and work practices.


===== 1.3	Purpose =====

The purpose of the OMSSP is to ensure a planned, documented, and organized response to actual and potential security threats to the system.  The Plan includes methods and strategies for detecting, deterring and responding to security threats.
This OMSSP:

  * Develops, documents, and communicates a comprehensive, responsive, appropriate, and effective security and emergency preparedness program;

  * Documents security and emergency preparedness goals and objectives for the Honolulu Rapid Transit Project (HRTP);

  * Serves as HRH’s point-of-reference for a complete and comprehensive description of its security program;

  * Supports the DTS System Security Program and Policy

As set forth in the security program policy, accountability for security and emergency preparedness of the HRTP rests with each employee, supervisor, manager, director, and department. As a result of this program, HRH and the HRTP will achieve not only an effective physical security program, but also develop an effective emergency preparedness program.

HRH’s plans for response to natural disaster or terrorism incidents are based on partnerships with the emergency management and first-responder organizations of the City and County of Honolulu and the island's coordinated plans.  This coordination is essential for the City’s response and recovery capabilities. At the same time, providing continuity of rail operations during a community-wide emergency is a vital capability for the island's recovery.

System security provides a structured methodology for analyzing threats and weighing the consequences of the cost of their resolution against the capabilities of the system to fund improvements. This process allows the system; whatever its size, service, or operating environment; to implement the most effective security and preparedness program possible within its available resources. System security promotes an integrated approach to protection, identifying how all system activities come together as part of an interdependent system that deters, detects, assesses, and responds to threats.

Within the context of this approach, emergency preparedness is a central feature of the program, ensuring the capability to mitigate and manage those events that cannot be prevented.

Emergency preparedness ensures that HRH has a process in place to provide fast, controlled and predictable responses to various types of emergencies that may occur within the system or nearby locations. Emergency preparedness identifies how other City agencies can both support and obtain support from HRH, in addressing transit-specific and area-wide emergencies.

===== 1.4	Applicability =====

This OMSSP establishes the activities that must be performed by all departments within HRH, and other subcontractors to ensure secure operations and work practices. The OMSSP establishes the security philosophy of HRH and provides the means and authority for implementing that philosophy.

====== 9 OMSSP Description ======

===== 9.1	Overview =====

This chapter demonstrates how the OMSSP management functions and responsibilities identified in the previous chapters are integrated into a cohesive and effective program. The elements of this program are presented using the POETE categorization specified by DHS/TSA and G&T in implementing the National Preparedness Goal: Planning, Organization, Equipment, Training/Procedures, and Emergency Exercises and Evaluation.


===== 9.2	Planning =====

Planning for the OMSSP program includes developing internal HRH plans to address OMSSP issues during HRTP’s operations; budgeting for system security and emergency preparedness functions;  addressing security requirements in system design and safety/security certification, renovations and rehabilitations; and coordinating with local emergency management agencies and public safety agencies to ensure integration of HRH into community response plans for major criminal events, terrorist activities (including the use of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and the release of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNE) agents), and natural disasters.


===== 9.3	Internal Planning: =====
 
Planning is an integral part of maintaining and operating a secure rail transit system. Stemming from state safety oversight requirements and DHS/G&T regulations and requirements, DTS and HRH (Level 2 P3 to be added once chosen) have developed a set of plans to document its combined activities to address issues affecting the safety and security of passengers and employees, HRH’s ability to protect its infrastructure from crime and terrorism, and HRH’s capabilities to provide effective emergency response to a wide range of emergencies. To this end, HRH has developed this OMSSP, as well as an O&M Provider Safety Plan (HNL-06011 - O&M Provider Safety Plan). In addition, HRH has prepared an EOP ([[hsqe:emergency-management:procedure:hnl-09007-emergency-management-plan|HNL-09007]] Emergency Management Plan), and a set of Incident Specific Response Plans for severe weather and natural disasters, a range of accident types and fires, and major crimes and terrorism.


===== 9.4	Coordination for Regional Emergency Preparedness Capabilities: =====
 
HRH has coordinated with both local and county governments and the emergency management agencies in its service area to support on-going development and revision of their respective EOPs and supporting incident management and response protocols and resource inventories. HRH has also partnered with other departments to ensure effective response to no-notice evacuations and emergencies, including events related to IED and CBRNE, earthquakes, fires and flooding.

DTS will establish Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)s with local law enforcement, emergency medical services, fire departments, hospitals and other transit providers on the island. These MOUs are also applicable to HRH as the contractor for the RTA. These MOUs provide direction and clarification regarding response to an incident occurring on property, and how HRH may support response to area-wide emergencies.


===== 9.5	Organization =====

Capabilities for HRH’s response to major crimes, terrorism and natural disaster emergencies will be organized following the Incident Management Organization specified in HRH’s EOP, as well as the procedures identified in HRH’s rulebooks and SOPs/Emergency Procedures, Work Instructions, HRH’s Crisis Communications Plan, the Level 2 security/police function’s General Orders, HRH’s Incident Specific Response Plans, and internal transit facility emergency emergency/evacuation plans. 

HRH’s Incident Management Organization provides an organized command and control structure to ensure (1) coordinated response across HRH’s departments/functions and (2) adequate resources are mobilized during emergency incidents. HRH’s Incident Management Organization is akin to the ICS used by local responders. This organization enables HRH to integrate effectively with the ICS established by public safety and emergency management agencies, complying with the terms of both NIMS and the Major Emergency Incident Management System protocols established for the regional area.  Further, HRH has identified these capabilities and also has established its own resources to prevent, detect, respond to and recover from these events.

The organization of terrorism or emergency incident response teams in HRH’s service area includes the following capabilities: canine teams, explosive ordinance disposal, hazardous materials, underwater dive teams, special weapons and tactics, emergency medical services, medical surge teams, and urban search and rescue. These teams are available throughout the rail transit system’s service area.

The SAIC is designed to integrate existing local, state and federal information systems to create a central “fusion” center. The center will partner with many different sources of information, fusing relevant information and distributing valuable information to private and public sectors, first responders and investigators.

Policies or procedures to coordinate within this organizational structure to share information include using an 800 MHz regional system owned by the City/State that enables cross-communication through defined talk-group templates.

The island is developing an interoperability plan per HSPD-8 addressing Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD)/data system and radio cross-communication among its county/city 9-1-1 centers; the DTS is a participant in developing the island’s HSPD-8 and G&T-required tactical interoperability communications plan (TICP).


===== 9.6	Training and Procedures =====

HRH is responsible for training for OMSSP-related topics is performed to ensure that:

  * Applicable management, operations, and maintenance rules, procedures, and plans are effectively documented and conveyed to those responsible for their implementation;

  * Manuals showing how to administer, operate, and maintain the system’s safety and security equipment and facilities are understood by those responsible for their use;

  * Safety-related rules and procedures for management, operations, and maintenance personnel are documented and effectively implemented by all employees as required;

  * Emergency procedures have been developed, documented and are successfully implemented by all personnel as required, including public safety personnel (if appropriate);

  * Transportation personnel and local emergency responders understand the hazards of the transportation environment; and

  * An adequate level of preparation is maintained for a possible emergency.

Training typically addresses rules, policies, and procedures, as well as many of the hazards in the transportation environment (e.g., live power, track and roadway safety, hazardous materials and alternate fuels, medical emergencies or blood-borne pathogen awareness, personal safety, and injury prevention). HRH and the P3 Developer provided level 2 security force will also establish an emergency response agency familiarization program that provides orientation for local law enforcement, fire personnel, and medical services regarding the transportation environment and its vehicles.

HRH will perform basic security awareness or first responder awareness training, which emphasizes topics, such as:

  * Understanding the specific threats from explosives, incendiary devices, and toxic materials (chemical, biological, or radiological agents) and the risks associated with them in an incident;

  * Understanding the potential outcomes associated with an emergency created when explosives, incendiary devices, or toxic materials are present;

  * The ability to recognize the presence of these devices and materials;

  * The ability to identify the classes of chemical agents, if possible, using signs and symptoms;

  * The ability to reference laminated cards and other automated and manual checklists to support initial response activities and incident reporting; and 

  * Proper use of personal protective equipment, such as escape hoods and gas masks.

HRH offer a training programs to support OMSSP implementation, as OMSSP elements are integrated into including initial and refresher training programs provided to all employees. In addition, HRH provides general security awareness training to all O&M departments and holds special seminars devoted to OMSSP topics with supervisors, managers and HRH’s executive leadership.

===== 9.7 Exercises and Drills =====

Going directly into a real emergency operation without exercising involves substantial risks. For example, many participants may not know or thoroughly understand their emergency responsibilities and how they relate to activities performed for other elements of the response; equipment may not function as expected; or procedures may not be as effective as anticipated.

Such risks, when thoughtfully considered, are unacceptable to most transportation agencies. Accordingly, a broad spectrum of exercise activity is necessary if functional emergency response and recovery capability is to be realistically assessed and improved.

Well-designed and executed exercises are the most effective means of:

  * Testing and validating policies, plans, procedures, training, equipment, and interagency agreements;

  * Clarifying and training personnel in roles and responsibilities;

  * Demonstrating mastery of standard and emergency operating procedures, communications, equipment, and public information dissemination;

  * Improving internal agency and interagency coordination and communications;

  * Identifying gaps in resources;

  * Improving individual performance; and

  * Identifying specific activities which should be taken to improve the response capability.

Exercises are also an excellent way to demonstrate community resolve and cooperation to prepare for disastrous events. Review of successful responses to emergencies over the years has shown that pre-emergency exercising pays huge dividends when an actual emergency occurs. This is especially true in instances where communities were involved full-scale exercises that tested the range of response activities, communications protocols, and resources to be applied.

In the rail transit environment, exercises provide an effective way to implement and fine-tune an agency’s emergency plan, provide training, and improve system safety and security.  Additionally, as a provider of a public service, HRH has a responsibility to:

  * Ensure customer and employee safety and security at all times;

  * Train employees so they know what to do when an emergency occurs;

  * Recognize that they are part of the regional emergency response effort; and

  * Correct gaps and vulnerabilities in the system.

Organizations that integrate exercise and evaluation programs into their preparedness activities can more efficiently and effectively execute their emergency response plans during an actual event.


====== 10 Threat and Vulnerability Identification, Assessment, and Resolution ======

===== 10.1 Overview =====

Planning in advance of day-to-day transit crimes, a terrorist act, or other security incident is essential in providing transit patrons and employees with a safe and secure environment. A breach in security may result in serious injuries or death, destruction of property and facilities, and the inability to continue transit operations to the island.  HART, acting for DTS will conduct a TVA to identify and resolve security vulnerabilities. The following section described security vulnerability management process used by HART in accordance with FTA Security and Emergency Preparedness Planning Guide.


===== 10.2 Threat and Vulnerability Identification =====

This section of the OMSSP describes the methods HART will use to identify security and terrorism-related threats and vulnerabilities. This process begins with the identification and prioritization of HRTP’s assets. Then, using HART’s process for security data collection and analysis, specific threats and vulnerabilities are identified for each prioritized asset.


===== 10.3 Asset Analysis =====

Project assets are defined as people (e.g., passengers, employees, contractors, visitors, surrounding communities, etc.), information (e.g., O&M procedures, computer network information, passwords and facility access codes), and property (e.g., stations, vehicles, buildings, communications systems, etc.). Asset analysis enables the Project team to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate assets thereby determining which are of most significance to the completed System. By identifying key assets, the Project team will be able to direct its resources towards hardening security at critical locations. 

The range of key assets for the Project are detailed in the TVA and considered SSI. Assets will be prioritized in terms of criticality. The most weight will be given to those assets that present the greatest threat to life safety or service disruption if attacked.

In making this determination, consideration will be given to the following:

  * Impact on patrons, transit employees, and emergency responders;

  * Impact on System operations;

  * Economic value of the asset, including current and replacement value;

  * Intrinsic value of the asset to a potential adversary;

  * Asset location to other critical assets


===== 10.4 Security Data Collection for the Identification of Threats and Vulnerabilities =====

HRH’s and the Developer provided Level 2 security function are the central point for collection, assessment, reporting and recordkeeping of security data and information involving the rail transit system. This security database includes standard crime analysis codes, and information sorted by geographic location, geographic area, day of week, time of day, and train route. 

Analysis of the security database is conducted continually to indicate patterns of criminal behavior occurring on the rail transit system, as a valuable tool used to help determine deployment of security resources on the system.  The P3 developer’s security/police function also receives security threat and crime intelligence through law enforcement sources on the island continually and concurrently, for assessment and incorporation into security personnel resource deployments and tactics and HRTP operations orders. Security data and information inputs to the security/police function include:

  * Security incident or breach reports from supervisors, operators, or other personnel;

  * Security incident or breach reports involving the transit system from local law enforcement agencies in the rail transit system’s service area;

  * Security threat and crime information from law enforcement sources on the island;

  * Security complaints from citizens and HRH customers;

  * Special event service plans and information from HRH’s operating and maintenance departments/functions, for assessment of security risks and incorporation of security plans into the overall service plan for the special event;

  * Security inspections and assessments of transit system facilities and operations performed by the security/police function (in collaboration with the system safety function and representatives of the facility user departments); and security-related information from individual HRTP employees and through DTS Safety and Security Committees.


===== 10.5 Overview =====

This section details critical assets as well as vulnerabilities and crime conditions for stations, park and rides, equipment and rail systems (vehicles, COMMS, etc.).   HART completed an overall Threat and Vulnerability Assessment (TVA) to identify the aforementioned elements.  A TVA allows to thoroughly evaluate potential threats, targets and vulnerabilities.  Asset analysis enables transit systems to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate their assets to determine which are most significant to the system.

Threat analysis is a process that enables transit systems to “define the level or degree of the threats against a facility by evaluating the intent, motivation, and possible tactics of those who may carry them out.” Vulnerability analysis is described as a process that can be used to identify “specific weaknesses with respect to how they may invite and permit a threat to be accomplished.”

The severity of threat and likelihood of occurrence (vulnerability) were combined into a risk-level matrix.  The risk impact was assessed in terms of severity and consequence and probability of occurrence for a given threat. Risk categorization was used to prioritize the risk impact and identify opportunities for further changes to the design, procedures, and other asset controls.

A site-specific TVA for each Station and Park and Ride will identify critical assets, vulnerabilities and crime conditions. Completion of these site-specific TVA’s are contingent of all civil construction, systems and overall completion.  To ensure a standardized process is used to asses’ buffer zones, station perimeters and station exteriors, the location specific assessment process shall be completed in quadrants.  Quadrants start on the mountain side or “Mauka” which in relation to our alignment points to the North and reciprocally the ocean side or “Makai” points towards the South.  If there’s a need to represent or describe a finding within the checklist, the description should be described, for example as “Mauka- Quadrant I – Site contains exposed conduit”.    


===== 10.6 Other Sources of Information - Security Reviews, Testing and Inspection Programs =====

HRH’s threat and vulnerability identification process also includes security testing and inspections. These activities are geared toward ensuring that equipment is operating properly, is readily available when needed, and that employees are proficient in the use of the equipment. To accomplish this, testing programs are developed for specific systems and equipment that not only assess the current state of security, but can also be used to upgrade staff effectiveness through training.

HRH will conduct formal reviews of every incident on its transit system which may require changes in, or additions to, operating procedures, training programs, or to the design of vehicles, equipment or facilities. Security or emergency incident reviews will generally be conducted through a to be established DTS’s Safety and Security Review Committee (SSRC). The CSSO typically leads the review process for security or emergency incidents. The incident reviews identify causes, and corrective actions, as appropriate.

HRH has designated employees at each of its operating facilities and office buildings, responsible to coordinate with occupant work groups at each facility and HRH’s security function to assure that internal security procedures are identified and followed, and that appropriate physical features and equipment for building/site security are identified, implemented and maintained at each work facility. At a typical operations facility, the security representatives are the maintenance and transportation operations managers of that location. In addition, monthly safety inspections of operating facilities, which are performed by these personnel, include inspections of security-related items. Managers responsible for maintenance of the respective facilities are responsible to correct any security items found noncompliant by the monthly safety/security inspections.

HRH also supports facility security representatives and operations managers by providing security assessments of transit system assets such as transit centers, park/ride facilities, light rail tunnel and stations, and operations facilities. Supplemental or update assessments may occur whenever prompted by identification of a vulnerability or in corrective action resulting from a security breach incident review.

Within the security function, security data and information is processed in three (3) functional areas:

  * The Security Data Coordinator, for both HRH security, continually collects, analyzes and reports data related to transit crime and security incidents, and maintains security information database;

  * Officers in the security/ HPD police function provide continuous identification and assessment of transit system security threats and vulnerabilities; and

  * Management staff in the security function continually translates incoming information into security plans and operations orders for personnel deployment, tactical operations, missions, investigations, and coordination of activities with HRH operating departments/functions and operations of local jurisdiction law enforcement agencies.

Security data and information outputs from the security function include:

  * Transit crime data is reported monthly to FTA's NTD, and to the state safety oversight agency;

  * Detailed reports provided during monthly Security Coordination Team meetings, including transit crime data reports and trend analysis, security incident reviews and recommendations, security plans for special event transit service or regional events affecting the transit system, facility security assessments, and security program recommendations; and

  * Reports from security inspections and assessments of transit system facilities.

In addition, the OCC reports rail transit security incidents meeting specified thresholds to the SOA, as required in 49 CFR Part 659. Every effort is made to issue these reports within two-hours of incident occurrence, as per the standard of 49 CFR § 659.33. Full investigations are conducted of these events, and corrective action plans are developed, reviewed and approved by the SOA, and tracked through to implementation by the security/police function.

As security issues are identified, they are documented and addressed through security design criteria; development of new procedures and practices; employee training; changes in the deployment of security personnel; and targeted integration with relevant local law enforcement and regional emergency management agencies. The security function takes the lead in coordinating HRH activity to address the results of security information collection.


===== 10.7 Identifying Threats for Prioritized Assets =====

Based on this security information collection and analysis process described above, HRH will identify specific threats for its list of prioritized assets. This activity is termed “threat analysis.” Threat analysis defines the level or degree of the threats against a prioritized asset by evaluating the intent, motivation, and possible tactics of those who may carry them out. The process involves gathering historical data about the ways in which criminals have perpetrated crimes on the systems and also, for terrorism, identifying ways in which threats could be carried out again the system. In performing this assessment, HRH should identify and evaluate which information, from all that is collected, is relevant in assessing the threats against the prioritized assets. This activity may be performed by the security function with the support of a consultant and the system safety function.

Specifically, for terrorism, possible methods of carrying out hostile actions in the transportation environment include:

===== 10.8	Threat and Vulnerability Assessment =====

Threat analysis, as described by the FTA, is a process which enables transit systems to “define the level or degree of the threats against a facility by evaluating the intent, motivation, and possible tactics of those who may carry them out.” Vulnerability assessment is described by the FTA as a process that can be used by transit systems to identify “specific weaknesses with respect to how they may invite and permit a threat to be accomplished.”

HRH will utilize these analysis methods to identify and evaluate the security related risks within the operating environments and surrounding communities of the System. The process may at times require the involvement of outside parties including Federal, State, and local law enforcement and emergency response agency representatives, and/or security experts. The primary forum for coordinating and addressing these issues will reside with the SSRC. 

The entire process involves gathering and evaluating relevant information including, but not limited to:

  * Security practices, protocols, crime deterrents, and other countermeasures currently in place within the City including an evaluation of their effectiveness;

  * Historical data pertaining to past security breaches and other security-related incidents directed towards the City or towards other similar systems;

  * Crime rate data in the communities and areas surrounding the System;

  * Site layout information such as the ease of accessibility, location of incoming utilities, hazardous storage materials locations, types of building construction, levels of lighting, etc;

  * Existing criminal or terrorist threats that may be present within the Project’s operating environment or which may be directed towards the surrounding communities that may impact the System;

  * The response capabilities of the City and emergency responders such as police, fire, and emergency rescue personnel.


===== 10.9	Scenario Analysis =====

Once key assets, potential threats and system vulnerabilities have been identified, threat scenarios can be developed to evaluate the types of potential attacks and outcomes that may be waged against and experienced by the system. The scenario analysis process combines information gained through the previous analysis.

Risk is expressed as a function of the ease of a given threat exploiting a given vulnerability and the magnitude of the impact suffered.

** Table 4 - Vulnerability Levels**

^ Description ^ Level ^ Ease of Access ^
| Very Easy | A | Very easy to access area or affected function undetected |
| Easy | B | Relatively easy to access area or function, no significant barriers to prevent |
| Difficult | C | Difficult to access area or function, various barriers in place |
| Very Difficult | D | Very difficult to access area or function, barriers very difficult to overcome |
| Too Difficult | E | Extremely difficult and cumbersome to access area or function. No history of incursion or attempted incursion |

** Table 5 - Threat Impact Categories**

^ Description ^ Category ^ Personnel ^ Service Disruption ^ Dollars Lost ^
| Catastrophic | I | Loss of Life | System Loss\\ Long Term (6 Months or More) Shutdown of Line | Above $1m |
| Critical | II | Injury / Serious Occupational Illness | Line Loss for <6 months\\ Loss of Critical Equipment | £250k to $1m |
| Marginal | III | Minor Injuries / Illness (no lost work days) | Line Loss <1 hr\\ Car Loss < 5 days | Below $250k |
| Negligible | IV | No injury or illness | No Service Loss | No Dollars lost |

Each threat scenario is then evaluated to determine its likelihood and severity. The criticality of an asset being attacked is finally expressed as High, Serious or Low as shown in FIXME **Error! Reference source not found.**

**Figure 3 - Security Criticality Matrix**

|  |  ^	Threat Impact ^^^^
|  |  |	I\\ Catastrophic | II\\ Critical | III\\ Marginal | IV\\ Negligible |
^ Vulnerability | (A) Very Easy | <alert type="danger">High</alert> | <alert type="danger">High</alert> | <alert type="warning">Serious</alert> | <alert type="warning">Serious</alert> |
^ ::: | (B) Relatively Easy | <alert type="danger">High</alert> | <alert type="danger">High</alert> | <alert type="warning">Serious</alert> | <alert type="success">Low</alert> |
^ ::: | (C) Difficult | <alert type="danger">High</alert> | <alert type="warning">Serious</alert> | <alert type="success">Low</alert> | <alert type="success">Low</alert> |
^ ::: | (D) Very Difficult | <alert type="warning">Serious</alert>| <alert type="success">Low</alert> | <alert type="success">Low</alert> | <alert type="success">Low</alert> |
^ ::: | (E) Too Difficult | <alert type="warning">Serious</alert>| <alert type="success">Low</alert> | <alert type="success">Low</alert> | <alert type="success">Low</alert> |

The Security Vulnerability Index value determines the specific level of action. Security Vulnerability ranked as high will not be permitted and must be eliminated or mitigated. Security Vulnerability Acceptance Criteria are provided in Error! Reference source not found.

**Table 6 - Security Vulnerability Acceptance Criteria**

^ Security Vulnerability Index ^ Acceptance Criteria ^
| IA, IB, IC, IIA, IIB | Vulnerability must be mitigated |
| ID, IE, IIC, IIIA, IIIB, IVA | Vulnerability should be mitigated if within possible fiscal constraints |
| IID, IIE, IIIC, IIID, IIIE, IVB, IVC, IVD, IVE | Vulnerability is acceptable with review |


===== 10.10	Threat and Vulnerability Resolution =====

Countermeasures and corrective actions are developed at the completion of the analysis process to eliminate or mitigate identified security threats and vulnerabilities. Effective countermeasures will typically include mutually supporting engineering and administrative elements. Examples of engineering countermeasures include:

 * Installing physical barriers

 * Installing integrated intrusion detection

 * Installing chemical, biological, radiological and / or nuclear detection devices

Administrative countermeasures include:

 * Increasing the frequency of patrols

 * Increasing security related training

===== 11.2	Evaluation =====

==== 11.2.1	Audit Process ====

The purpose of the HRH Internal Security Audit Process is to document and establish an audit system for continual measurement, improvement, and appraisal of the administrative process with regard to system security and emergency preparedness. The three entities will be working together to define an audit process all are supporting. Audits seek to discover program compliance as well as imperfect performance that may result in incidents with an adverse effect on HRH, its customers, employees, and the general public. This process and its scope encompass all elements of the OMSSP and Procedures as required by 49 CFR 659 and Section 3 of the HDOT Program Standard.

The objectives of the Internal Security Audit include the following:

  * To provide a system to independently and objectively measure and quantify work being done to manage and control security conditions.

  * To provide a system to guide the development and improvement of the System Security Plan.

  * To provide a complete or total systematic approach to system security management


==== 11.2.2	Audit Scope ====

The HRH Internal Security Audit Program encompasses the audits required by the state safety oversight agency, HDOT, facility inspections, and periodic audits in the areas of O&M. From time to time HRH Security may also be subjected to other security audits required by the FTA, DHS, TSA, HDOT, or deemed warranted by HRH/DTS Security management. 

Some audits/reviews are formal, others unannounced, and as needed.  Areas that are included in the internal audit process and required by 49 CFR 659 includes:

  * Policies, goals and objectives for the security program

  * Threat and vulnerability process

  * Passenger and employee security controls and programs

  * Internal security review process

  * Compliance with HDOT review and approval requirements

==== 11.2.3	Audit Schedule ====

Scheduling of system security and emergency management audits typically will be at the discretion of the HRH Head of Safety.  Security Plan audits are required at least every three years, commencing with the City fiscal year 2021(starting July 1, 2020).  The OMSSP audit schedule will be included in the overall annual safety and security audit schedule provided to DTS in the first quarter of each calendar year.  DTS will also be notified at least thirty days prior to the HRH Head of Safety conducting any scheduled security audit.


==== 11.2.4	Audit Responsibility ====

For the purpose of this OMSSP and compliance with 49 CFR Part 659 and HDOT Program Standard, the HRH Head of Safety is responsible for initiating and conducting system security and emergency preparedness audits.

The HRH Head of Safety is responsible for developing and distributing standard procedures to be followed when conducting planned/formal audits. The reviewed departments are informed of the audit/review and are provided with information regarding the purpose, scope, and content of the planned security audit/review.  Preliminary findings are communicated as soon as practicable to enable expeditious corrective action.  Follow-up audits/reviews are conducted without advance notice.


==== 11.2.5	Audit Documentation ====

Pre-developed checklists and established procedures are provided prior to each audit.

The HRH Head of Safety is responsible for documenting the purpose, scope, content, and results of internal security/audit.

HRH submits an annual report to the DTS CSSO by February 15th of each year that documents the following:

A listing of the internal safety and security audits conducted for that year.

The process for the three-year internal audit schedule, including the identification of any obstacles in meeting the schedule and any proposed mitigation measures.

An updated schedule for the following year’s audits, the status of all findings, recommendations, and corrective actions resulting from the audits conducted that year.

Any challenges or issues experienced by HRH Security in obtaining action from/compliance with these findings, recommendations, and corrective actions during that year.

A formal letter of certification, signed by the HRH Head of Safety, stating that, based on the evaluation performed during the internal security audit process during the previous year, HRH Security complies with its OMSSP.  If HRH finds that it does not comply with its OMSSP, the letter must identify the activities that HRH Security will take to achieve compliance.


====== 12 Modification of OMSSP ======

===== 12.1 Overview =====

The OMSSP (this document) is developed in accordance with the applicable clauses of 49 CFR Part 659 § 659.17 in which the FTA identified the 5 elements to be included in the System Safety Program Plan (SSPP). The clause (d) requires defining the process used to control changes to the System Security Program Plan.

The following section describes the OMSSP review schedule and the control and update procedures for the initial submission, annual submissions, and periodic submissions.


===== 12.2 OMSSP Control and Update Procedures =====

==== 12.2.1	Review of Annual Submission ====

Following the initiation of revenue service, HRH will conduct an annual review of its OMSSP and update it as necessary to ensure that the OMSSP is current at all times.

In the event that HRH conducts its annual OMSSP review and determines that an update is not necessary for the year, it will prepare and submit by January 1 a formal correspondence notifying DTS CSSO of this determination.

In the event that HRH conducts its annual OMSSP review and determines that an update is necessary for the year, HRH will submit a revised OMSSP to DTS CSSO by January 31. As appropriate, referenced materials affected by the revision(s) must also be submitted with the OMSSP.
