===== 1 Scope =====
==== 1.1 Purpose ====
The purpose of the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) is to insure that HRH employees, contractors and visitors at all Honolulu Rail Transit Project (HRTP) facilities are prepared for, and receive guidance on what to do in the event of an emergency. 

An emergency is defined as the unforeseen combination of circumstances that requires immediate action.  The best way to protect yourself in an emergency is to prepare in advance. This document is designed to help reinforce your actions in the emergencies described within this plan.

All occupants must familiarize themselves with these procedures.  When an emergency evacuation is required, the primary goal is to reach a point of safety.  

Evacuation drills are to be taken seriously.  Individuals are more likely to survive an emergency if they learn what to do in advance.  All evacuation drills give personnel an introduction on how to respond in a real emergency. 

Tests such as fire drills are used for ensuring the systems alerting functions are working properly, checks our ability to take appropriate actions and ensures overall accountability. All personnel should be familiar with the sound of the evacuation alert and cooperate fully during evacuation drills.

In an emergency, it is important to cooperate with Emergency Response Team members, as well as other emergency response personnel, such as firefighters, emergency medical crews, police and HRH safety officers.

If you have any questions about these procedures, please contact your immediate supervisor or any AHJV safety representative.

\\
==== 1.2 Applicability ====
This document describes the emergency action plan for all HRH employees, contractors, HRTP staff, and visitors of the Maintenance and Storage Facility (MSF) incorporating the Operations and Servicing Building (OSB) and the Maintenance of Way Building (MOB).

Emergency evacuation plans are developed by HRH to include all work areas, subcontractors, the office areas and any remote locations.

Each subcontractor is responsible for adopting this Emergency Action Plan or introduce their own Emergency Action Plan that is compliant with this plan.  Subcontractors must coordinate their plans with HRH’s safety and security requirements.

Not applicable for the first issue.

\\
===== 2 Emergency Action Plan Implementation =====
\\
==== 2.1 Responsibilities ====
\\
=== 2.1.1 HRH HSE Manager ===
HRH HSE Manager is responsible for oversight, participation and management of the Emergency Action Plan.  
The HRH HSE Manager is responsible for oversight of emergencies related to the safety of all employees and visitors, as well as any environmental impact.  

The entire HSE team can assist in the implementation of the Emergency Action Plan for all facility.  HSE encourages all employees to have a current copy of the EAP.  A current copy is always available at the HSE office.

\\
=== 2.1.2 Emergency Response Team ===
Emergency Response Team members are persons designated by the HSE department to assist in building evacuations and communications in the event of an emergency.  

There shall be one ERT Leader for each MSF floor or office area.  There will be two (2) floor monitors, one male and one female, to perform a sweep of the floor areas to ensure that everyone has been notified to evacuate.  The floor monitors will be trained on established procedures for entering locker rooms and restrooms of the opposite gender.

The list of personnel appointed to these positions will be kept updated on a regular basis as to identify changes in personnel.  The floor monitors are included in this EAP and will be posted on the communication boards.

\\
== 2.1.2.1 Emergency Response Team Leaders ==
Familiarization training by the HSE department will be provided to ERT Leaders.
Emergency response team leaders shall:
					
•	Keep, maintain and make readily available the Emergency Action Plan.

•	Familiarize themselves and other employees with the location of fire alarm pull stations and exits, or any specialized emergency equipment that they have been provided training for.  

•	Ensure that exits and exit access ways are kept clear and unobstructed in their areas.

•	Implement floor-clearing procedures and verify that evacuation of their floor or office areas is completed. Provide safeguards for any disabled persons on their floor or office areas. 

•	Confirm that areas of responsibility are clear of occupants once outside of the building at the assembly area. Reconcile the visitor log, if visitors remain unaccounted for, they will be contacted on the telephone number provided in the visitors log.

\\
== 2.1.2.2 Emergency Response Team Members ==
ERT members will be utilized to walk through their floor or office areas checking closet spaces, lavatories, and other remote or out of the way areas to ensure that everyone has been notified to evacuate the building.  

\\
== 2.1.2.3 HRH Operations and Maintenance Personnel ==
All O&M staff are responsible for the emergency processes and procedures associated with the facility.  They are a readily available resource for emergency and recovery operations.  O&M personnel have use of two-way radios and cellular telephones for normal communication, as well as emergencies.  

\\
=== 2.1.3 All supervisors, employees, and visitors ===
Will receive direction for clear understanding of their role in each emergency and for complying with emergency instructions to evacuate promptly when necessary.

\\
==== 2.2 Training ====
Training is arranged at various times throughout the year. Safety will hold drills as training opportunities and learning experiences.  The focus of these drills is to provide an introduction on how to respond to emergencies in accordance with this plan.  

\\
==== 2.3 Tabletops, Drills, and Exercises ====
In order to gauge the effectiveness of the Emergency Action Plan, training and drills, exercises will be conducted regularly. At least one drill or exercise will be performed per year for each location within the MSF. The following summarize the general format for available activities:

  * Tabletops – Key personnel gather for a meeting to verbally work through a stated scenario.  The purpose of this activity is to familiarize key personnel with the requirements of certain responses and to conduct training. Tabletops will be planned.

  * Drills – Drills involve personnel working within a given area (limited in scope to minimize impacts to overall work production). Drills are conducted on the work site, and personnel are tasked with responding to an accident scenario based on their training and the plans available.  Drills may not be announced in advance (though coordination may occur with site management personnel).  The HRH HSE will initiate drills.

  * Exercises – Exercises are integrated events designed to test the overall response to a multi-part incident. They generally include a series of drills and tabletops. Due to the significant effort required to conduct exercises, one will only be scheduled in the event that drills and tabletops alone are evaluated as insufficient, and at the discretion of HRH HSE 
 
Tabletops, drills, and exercises will be designed to focus on potential incidents associated with the project and scope of activities occurring at the time
