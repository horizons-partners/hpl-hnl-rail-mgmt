===== 1 Scope =====
\\
==== 1.1 Purpose ====
The purpose of the **__Emergency Action Plan__ (EAP)** is to insure that HRH employees and visitors at all Honolulu Rail Transit Project (HRTP) facilities are prepared for, and receive guidance on what to do in the event of an emergency. 

An emergency is defined as the unforeseen combination of circumstances that requires immediate action. The best way to protect yourself in an emergency is to prepare in advance. This document is designed to help reinforce your actions in the emergencies described within this plan.

All occupants must familiarize themselves with these procedures.  When an emergency evacuation is required, the primary goal is to reach the safe point.  

Evacuation drills are to be taken seriously. Individuals are more likely to survive an emergency if they learn what to do in advance. All evacuation drills give personnel the chance to be familiar on how to respond in a real emergency situation. 

Tests such as fire drills are used for ensuring the systems alerting functions are working properly, checks our ability to take appropriate actions and ensures overall accountability. All personnel should be familiar with the sound of the evacuation alert and cooperate fully during evacuation drills.

In an emergency, it is important to cooperate with Emergency Response Team members, as well as other emergency response personnel, such as firefighters, emergency medical crews, police and HRH safety officers.  

If you have any questions about these procedures, please contact your immediate supervisor or any HRH safety representative.

\\
==== 1.2 Applicability ====
This document describes the emergency action plan for all HRH employees HRTP staff, and visitors of the Maintenance and Storage Facility (MSF).

Emergency evacuation plans are developed by the HRH to include all work areas, subcontractors, the office areas and any remote locations.

Each subcontractor is responsible for adopting this Emergency Action Plan or introduces their own Emergency Action Plan.  Subcontractors must coordinate their plans with the HRH’s safety and security requirements.

\\
===== 4 Emergency Scenarios =====
The following instructions provide **//guidance//** on the appropriate actions to take in different types of emergencies.  **__Remember__** - No instruction is so inclusive that every situation is covered entirely. These are general starting points and should be tailored as situations demand.  

Please become familiar with these guidelines immediately and then review them on a regular basis.  When an emergency occurs, it is time to **//ACT - NOT READ!//**

In all cases, **__DO NOT PANIC__**. - Staying calm helps one to focus on the required actions.  Prompt and appropriate action can save lives, including your own!

The Emergency Scenarios include but not exclusive to:

  * General Evacuation

  * Suspicious package

  * Bomb Threats

  * Chemical Spills

  * Fire

  * Power Outages

  * Medical Emergencies

  * Threatening behavior e.g.: trespasser, slamming doors, threatening voice-mails, e-mails, or other written threats

  * Active shooter

  * Violent weather

  * Tsunami

  * Nuclear Incident/Attack

\\
==== 4.1 General Evacuation ====
  * Take all alarms seriously – one’s life and the lives of others may depend upon prompt action.  Strict adherence to the evacuation plan should be followed for every event, whereas one can never know if the alarm is real or was inadvertently caused.

  * Know where stairways, exits, fire extinguishers, and first aid kits are.  Having to search for them in the event of an emergency wastes precious time.

  * Learn an alternate way out of the building in case the normal route is blocked.  Floor plans are posted near stairwells and entryways.

  * Remember to follow the EAP (HNL-09300)

\\
=== 4.1.1 General Evacuation Procedure ===
1.	Recognize the sound of the alarm. Make sure that hearing - impaired employees or visitors are aware that the alarm has sounded.

2.	Evacuate immediately when the fire alarm activates or when asked to do so by an ERT member or other emergency personnel.

3.	Take your car keys, purse and coat with you if they are within reach at the time of the alarm. DO NOT go back to your work area to retrieve them if you are in another part of the building.  DO NOT delay in evacuating in order to get personal possessions.

4.	Stay Calm - do not run or push.  Exit at a walking speed and remain calm.

5.	Follow the directions of emergency personnel. These may be ERT members, firefighters, police, etc.

6.	Help others, especially the disabled or injured.

7.	Be alert for falling objects, trip hazards, and areas of limited disability, live wires, etc.

8.	Open doors carefully, checking for heat by touching the door surface with the back of your hand - not your palm (This will prevent a burn to a critical part of your body).  A hot surface indicates that a fire could be behind the door.

9.	Close, but do not lock, doors as you exit.  This can significantly slow the spread of fire, smoke, and hazardous vapors.

10.	DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE THE ELEVATORS.  Go immediately to the nearest emergency exit / stairway. Use the handrails provided in the stairwell and watch your footing. Stay to one side of the stairwell and be prepared to allow emergency personnel that may be trying to go upstairs, to pass you.\\ Remember - smoke rises.  If smoke is present, stay low and crawl on the floor if necessary. However, be aware that in certain situations involving certain gases or toxic chemicals, vapors can sink to the floor.  Cover your nose and mouth with a wet towel or clothing, if possible.

11.	If trapped in a room by smoke or fire:

  * Stay Calm

  * Close all doors between you and the fire

  * Seal cracks around doors and vents with whatever is available

  * Attempt to telephone 911 and advise them of your situation

  * Signal rescuers by waving a bright piece of cloth or other item

12.	Once out of the building proceed to your pre-arranged Reunification Area (See Figure 1), report to your ERT leader, and await further instruction.\\ For the purpose of emergency evacuations, disabled or physically challenged persons are considered to be those persons that have any physical condition(s) that render them unable to walk down the stairwells without assistance.  These conditions are not solely restricted to persons confined to wheelchairs.

13.	The decision in evacuating disabled or physically challenged personnel will be based solely on conditions that arise during the emergency. Disabled personnel in the buildings are to be evacuated by emergency personnel only if deemed necessary. Disabled or physically challenged personnel should never be left unattended during emergencies, unless it is unsafe to stay with them.

The Emergency Evacuation Procedure for MSF is presented in Annex 1.

\\
==== 4.2 Suspicious Package ====
1.	Be Vigilant - Letters or packages suspected of containing biochemical agents, bombs, or other harmful items often have suspicious characteristics.

Some characteristics of suspicious packages and letters include the following:

  * Excessive postage

  * Handwritten or poorly typed addresses

  * Incorrect titles

  * Title, but no name

  * Misspellings of common words

  * Oily stains, discolorations, or odor

  * Open mail with the minimum amount of movement

  * Do not blow into envelopes

  * Do not shake or pour out contents

  * Keep mail away from nose and mouth when opening mail

  * Wash hands with soap and water after handling mail

3.	If you receive a suspicious package or letter, gently place it on your work surface.  Avoid shaking or jarring the package.  Do not touch or otherwise examine any contents that may have leaked out of the package.  Alert the other personnel in the immediate vicinity and leave the area, securing it if possible.  Immediately, notify a 911 dispatcher and your supervisor. 

\\
==== 4.3 Bomb Threats ====
1.	ALL BOMB THREATS SHALL BE TREATED AS IF AN EXPLOSION WILL RESULT.  There is no way to guess which threat is real and which threat is a hoax.  Until such time that the threat has been investigated and the authority having jurisdiction has declared that the threat has been mitigated, you should follow the procedures outlined below.

2.	If you receive a threat by telephone:

  * Remain calm and be firm while asking the following questions:\\ o Where is the bomb located?\\ o What does it look like?\\ o When is it set to explode?\\ o Can we deactivate it?\\ o Why was the bomb placed here?\\ o What is your name?  (Not all criminals are geniuses)\\ o Do you have a phone number in case we get disconnected (try to write down the number from Caller ID?\\ o Listen for and document characteristics of the caller such as gender, accent, speech characteristics, etc.

  * DO NOT TOUCH THE SUSPECTED DEVICE and not use cell phones, radios, or other electronic devices within range of a suspicious device.– leave it for the professionals.

  * Minimize the use of wireless communication. That external signals could trigger the suspected device and cause catastrophic consequences.

  * DO NOT WALK PAST THE SUSPECTED DEVICE UNLESS IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY IN ORDER TO EVACUATE THE BUILDING.

  * IF YOU MUST PASS IN THE PROXIMITY OF THE SUSPECTED DEVICE, DO NOT DISTURB THE CRIME SCENE.

3.	If you receive a written threat: 

  * Handle the letter and any envelope as little as possible.

  * If the threat is not immediate, notify the senior responsible person on site and the Police. 

  * If the threat is immediate, notify 911, the Police, and then the senior responsible person on site.

  * DO NOT TOUCH THE SUSPECTED DEVICE and not use cell phones, radios, or other electronic devices within range of a suspicious device – leave it for the professionals.

  * Minimize the use of wireless communication. That external signals could trigger the suspected device and cause catastrophic consequences.

  * DO NOT WALK PAST THE SUSPECTED DEVICE UNLESS IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY IN ORDER TO EVACUATE THE BUILDING.

  * IF YOU MUST PASS IN THE PROXIMITY OF THE SUSPECTED DEVICE, DO NOT DISTURB THE CRIME SCENE.

\\
==== 4.4 Chemical Spills ====
Review the SDS and become familiar with the hazard classification of the chemical(s) that are in your area and the ones you are working with.

2.	Learn the location of the Spill Control Station nearest your work area and become familiar with the materials provided to control small spills

3.	Only trained personnel shall clean chemical spills. Use the proper protective equipment according the nature of the chemicals.

4. 	Contact the HRH HSE department in the event of a chemical spill. 

5.	If the spill is greater than that which can be controlled by you, employees and guests should be instructed to evacuate the facility in an orderly manner, following the fire evacuation plan.

\\
==== 4.5 Fire ====
1.	REMAIN CALM

2.	Alert the  TCO at #808-379-2121 

3.	Activate the fire alarm system. This is accomplished by operating a manually activated fire alarm pull station.

Fire alarm pull stations are typically located at each stairwell exit door on each floor as well as various locations throughout the floor. Access to these devices must be maintained at all time. Audible alarms accompanied by strobe lights will by initiated once the alarm is pulled. The following illustrates how these devices are activated:

{{:hsqe:emergency-management:procedure:hnl-09300-p02.png?600|}}

4.	Fight or Flight - After you have activated the alarm system and contacted the TCO , you can make the decision to leave the building or, if you determine that the fire is small enough, you can choose to use a fire extinguisher to suppress the fire (let the TCO know your position and that you are staying to fight the fire).  **//YOU SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT TO DO THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN THE USE OF FIRE EXTINGUISHERS.//** If you do choose to fight the fire, make sure you provide yourself an escape route. If you cannot control the fire with one extinguisher, the fire is too large for you to suppress and you should leave the building.

5.	Re-entry Procedure. ERT Leader receives notification from appropriate emergency personnel that building is safe to re-enter and clear for fire alarm to be reset.

6.	After confirmation of the re-arming of fire detection system, the ERT Leader will release personnel back into the facility. 

\\
=== 4.5.1. Portable Fire Extinguisher Operation ===
The fire extinguishers in the facility are rated for class A, B, and C fires. They have been strategically placed to provide a travel distance not greater than 75 feet from any point in your facility.  Building occupants should note their locations and familiarize themselves with the operating instructions of the units found in their facility.  A, B, C Dry Chemical extinguishers suppress fires by dispensing a coat of non-flammable, and non-electrically conductive powder over the fuel, separating it from the heat and oxygen needed for combustion.

\\
=== 4.5.2 Halocarbon (Fm 200) Fire Protection Systems ===
Parts of MSF facility have their contents protected by a Halocarbon (called FM-200) fire protection systems. Special attention should be given to your evacuation plan in the event that you are in one of these areas should this system be activated.  Halocarbon system once activated will displace oxygen making it an immediate danger for personnel to stay in the area.

1.	Remain Calm

2.	Be aware that there is a system pre-activation alert tone that gives you advanced notice (usually 10 seconds) to leave the protected area before the agent is released. FM200 systems reach extinguishing levels in 10 seconds or less, stopping ordinary combustible, electrical, and flammable liquid fires before they cause significant damage. FM200 extinguishes the fire quickly, which means less damage, lower repair costs You should become familiar with the sound of the pre-alerting tone. When it sounds, evacuate the area IMMEDIATELY.

3.	Plan in advance where your primary and secondary exits are located.

4.	As you leave the area, make sure that you secure the door to prevent the loss of the suppression agent.

5.	The MSF systems have an “Abort” button or switch that can be activated in the event that the system is about to activate unnecessarily.  Learn the location, operation and any other policies associated with the operation of this device. 

\\
==== 4.6 Fire Prevention ====
Part of a well-developed Emergency Action Plan describes how fires can be prevented by some basic fire prevention steps. The following information identifies most common causes of fire found in most buildings, and the preventive measures taken to control them.

=== 4.6.1 Flammable Liquids ===
1.	Keep flammable and combustible liquids in appropriate UL approved fire and leak proof containers.  Do not store more than a one-day’s supply outside of a flammable materials storage locker. 

2.	Use less flammable fluids whenever possible.

3.	Eliminate the effects of static electricity by grounding all storage containers.

4.	Smoking or open flames shall be prohibited a minimum of 50 feet  in areas where flammable liquids are stored.
  
5.	Flammable liquids shall be stored in well ventilated areas to prevent the buildup of highly combustible fumes and vapors.

6.	Flammable liquids shall be stored in fireproof cabinets whenever possible or separated from electrical equipment and other heat sources.

\\
=== 4.6.2 Spontaneous Ignitions ===
1.	Keep oily rags in a metal container secured with a metal lid.

2.	Keep incompatible chemicals stored separately from each other.  Consult the Safety Data Sheets (SDS) that are provided with each product, for information on proper storage.

3.	Keep areas where these items are stored neat and clean.

\\
=== 4.6.3 Good Housekeeping ===
1.	Prevent the accumulation of combustible materials in aisles, passageways and corridors.

2.	Keep exit doors, extinguishing equipment and fire alarm devices accessible and clear of obstructions.

3.	Keep sprinkler heads free from obstruction, there must be at least 18” of clearance below the bottom of the sprinkler head for it to operate efficiently. 

4.	Keep work areas neat and clean to prevent rapid fire spread should ignition occur.

\\
=== 4.6.4 Electrical Hazards ===
1.	Use only grounded, 3 prong appliances and cords.

2.	Never overload electrical outlets.

3.	Use only U-L approved heavy duty extension cords rated for appliance use.

4.	See to the periodic inspection of appliances and repair all electrical shorts.  Replace wires when insulation is frayed or worn.

5.	Never leave equipment, appliances, or machinery that produces excessive heat left running unattended.

O&M is responsible for maintenance of equipment and systems installed to prevent or control ignitions or fires.

\\
==== 4.7 Power Outages ====
Power outages in most buildings are generally just an inconvenience, not a life threatening event. Our buildings are provided with emergency generators and/or emergency lighting.  However, in the event that these fail, there are some guidelines to be observed:

1.	Remain calm.

2.	Stop what you are doing and remain motionless for a few minutes.  Your night vision will greatly improve as it adjusts to the absence of light.

3.	If you absolutely need to move from your position, move slowly and carefully.  The chance of receiving an impact injury or suffering a fall is greatly increased as visibility is reduced.

4.	To avoid possible damage when the power returns, shut off your computer, radio, or other electronic devices.

\\
==== 4.8 Medical Emergencies ====
1.	Familiarize yourself with the location of Automatic External Defibrillator (AED), medical equipment including personal protection equipment (PPE) before a medical emergency arises.\\ If you are not qualified to give first aid, assist those who are if needed, otherwise stay clear of the person having the medical emergency.

2.	If the need for medical assistance occurs, and you are a qualified first aid provider, begin to render aid as soon as possible.

3.	Require  someone assisting you to contact the ERT Commander and if required tell them to call 911. Have someone meet the emergency responders and direct them to person needing assistance. If you are alone, contact 911 and remain on the line, before you begin to render aid in order to get additional help as soon as possible.

4.	Always use PPE in order to prevent the spread of blood borne pathogens or other infectious diseases.

5.	Stay with the victim until emergency medical technicians or other professional assistance arrives.

\\
==== 4.9 Threatening Behavior ==== 
Confrontational situations can arise involving you and the general public or a disgruntled employee.

1.	If you observe a confrontation and you are not directly involved:

  * Remain calm

  * Do not confront the situation yourself

  * Contact the TCO 

  * Notify your supervisor as soon as possible

2.	If you are directly involved with a confrontation:
  * Remain calm

  * Attempt to signal someone to assist you

  * Try to move away from the threatening party

  * Attempt to place some object, a desk or counter, between you and the assailant, try not to get “blocked in” (have an escape route)

  * Do not antagonize or otherwise try to escalate the situation

  * Contact the appropriate Police agency (911) as soon as practicable 

  * Notify your supervisor as soon as possible

\\
==== 4.10 Active Shooter ====
An Active Shooter is an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area; in most cases, active shooters use firearms(s) and there is no pattern or method to their selection of victims. 

Active shooter situations are unpredictable and evolve quickly. Typically, the immediate deployment of law enforcement is required to stop the shooting and mitigate harm to victims. 

Because active shooter situations are often over within 10 to 15 minutes, before law enforcement arrives on the scene, individuals must be prepared both mentally and physically to deal with an active shooter situation.

\\
=== 4.10.1 How To Respond When An Active Shooter Is In Your Vicinity ===
Quickly determine the most reasonable way to protect your own life. Remember that customers and clients are likely to follow the lead of employees and managers during an active shooter situation.  It is imperative you keep your awareness of your surrounding at the highest level possible.

1. RUN\\ If there is an accessible escape path, attempt to evacuate the premises. Be sure to:

  * Have an escape route and plan in mind 

  * Evacuate regardless of whether others agree to follow 

  * Leave your belongings behind 

  * Keep yourself safe first and help others escape, if possible 

  * Prevent individuals from entering an area where the active shooter may be 

  * Keep your hands visible 

  * Follow the instructions of any police officers 

  * Do not attempt to move wounded people 

  * Call 911 when you are safe

2. HIDE\\ If evacuation is not possible, find a place to hide where the active shooter is less likely to find you. Your hiding place should: 

  * Be out of the active shooter’s view 

  * Provide protection if shots are fired in your direction (i.e., an office with a closed and locked door) 

  * Not trap you or restrict your options for movement

To prevent an active shooter from entering your hiding place: 

  * Lock the door 

  * Blockade the door with heavy furniture 

If the active shooter is nearby:

  * Lock the door

  * Silence your cell phone and/or pager

  * Turn off any source of noise (i.e., radios, televisions)

  * Hide behind large items (i.e., cabinets, desks) 

  * Remain quiet

If evacuation and hiding out are not possible: 

  * Remain calm 

  * Dial 911, if possible, to alert police to the active shooter’s location 

  * If you cannot speak, leave the line open and allow the dispatcher to listen

3. FIGHT\\ As a last resort, and only when your life is in imminent danger, attempt to disrupt and/or incapacitate the active shooter by: 

  * Acting as aggressively as possible against him/her 

  * Throwing items and improvising weapons

  * Yelling 

  * Committing to your actions

\\
=== 4.10.2 How To Respond When Law Enforcement Arrives ===
Law enforcement’s purpose is to stop the active shooter as soon as possible. Officers will proceed directly to the area in which the last shots were heard. 

  * Officers usually arrive in teams of four (4) 

  * Officers may wear regular patrol uniforms or external bulletproof vests, Kevlar helmets, and other tactical equipment 

  * Officers may be armed with rifles, shotguns, handguns 

  * Officers may use pepper spray or tear gas to control the situation 

  * Officers may shout commands, and may push individuals to the ground for their safety

How to react when law enforcement arrives:

  * Remain calm, and follow officers’ instructions 

  * Put down any items in your hands (i.e., bags, jackets) 

  * Immediately raise hands and spread fingers. Keep hands visible at all times. 

  * Avoid making quick movements toward officers such as holding on to them for safety

  * Avoid pointing, screaming and/or yelling

  * Do not stop to ask officers for help or direction when evacuating, just proceed in the direction from which officers are entering the premises

Information to provide to law enforcement or 911 operator:

  * Location of the active shooter

  * Number of shooters, if more than one

  * Physical description of shooter/s

  * Number and type of weapons held by the shooter/s

  * Number of potential victims at the location

The first officers to arrive to the scene will not stop to help injured persons. Expect rescue teams comprised of additional officers and emergency medical personnel to follow the initial officers. These rescue teams will treat and remove any injured persons. They may also call upon able-bodied individuals to assist in removing the wounded from the premises.

Once you have reached a safe location or an assembly point, you will likely be held in that area by law enforcement until the situation is under control, and all witnesses have been identified and questioned. Do not leave until law enforcement authorities have instructed you to do so.

\\
==== 4.11 Severe Weather Also See HNL-09312 Severe Weather Plan ====
