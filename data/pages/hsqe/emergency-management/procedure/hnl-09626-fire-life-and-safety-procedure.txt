\\
===== 2 Fire Safety Principles =====
HRH’s arrangements for fire safety are based on the following principles:

  * Risk Awareness – Location specific Fire Risk Assessments are conducted for all premises.

  * Prevention - All reasonably practicable control measures will be applied to prevent the outbreak of fire. Regular inspections will be conducted to ensure that identified measures are in place and working.

  * Preparation – Plans are in place to respond in the event of a fire, staff are trained and practiced in their roles and responsibilities

  * Maintenance – Fire protection and suppression systems and equipment will be maintained and tested as part of the maintenance regime for each facility.

\\
===== 3 Landlords =====
\\
==== 3.1 HRH Controlled Infrastructure ====
Each premises will have a person identified as being in charge of that location. This person, known as the Landlord is responsible for ensuring that:

•	An up to date Fire Risk Assessment is in place.

•	Suitable emergency response and evacuation arrangements are in place, including the appointment of Fire Wardens.

•	All staff within their control have received suitable and sufficient training to enable them to comply with this procedure and any local instructions.

•	Fire drills and evacuation exercises are undertaken and recorded in accordance with the requirements of the Fire Risk Assessment. 

•	Visitors are briefed on the fire and emergency arrangements for that location.

•	Prior authorization is in place through the Work Block Permit process for works or materials that may increase the risk of fire and that the control measures identified through that process are in place.
General guidance on fire safety management arrangements is provided in Annex A.

\\
==== 3.2 HRH Employees on Infrastructure Controlled by Others ====
HRH employees visiting or working in premises or on infrastructure controlled by others must familiarize themselves with the local fire and emergency arrangements prior to commencing work.

\\
===== 4 Fire Risk Assessment =====
A Fire Risk Assessment (FRA) will be undertaken for all premises under HRH Control. 
The aims of the fire risk assessment are: 

  * to identify the fire hazards; 

  * to reduce the risk of those hazards causing harm to as low as reasonably practicable; and 

  * to decide what physical fire precautions and management arrangements are necessary to ensure the safety of people in the premises if a fire does start.

The process of conducting the FRA includes:

  * Identify hazards\\ o sources of ignition, fuel and oxygen

  * Identify people at risk\\ o	people in and around the premises and those especially at risk (vulnerable people etc)

  * Evaluation, removal or reduction of risk\\ o	Evaluate the risk of a fire occurring and the risk to people from fire.\\ o	Remove or reduce fire hazards and the risks to people (Detection and warning, firefighting, escape routes, lighting, signage and notices, maintenance).

  * Record, plan, inform, instruct and train\\ o	Record significant findings and action plan\\ o	Inform and instruct relevant people, co-operate and co-ordinate with others\\ o	Provide training

The Fire Risk Assessment shall be recorded on the HNL-09627 Fire Risk Assessment Form. A copy shall be held locally as well as a copy provided to the HSSEQ Department.

  * Review and update\\ o	Keep assessment under review and revise where necessary.

\\
===== 5 Fire and Life Safety Training and Competence =====
\\
==== 5.1 Fire Awareness Training ====
