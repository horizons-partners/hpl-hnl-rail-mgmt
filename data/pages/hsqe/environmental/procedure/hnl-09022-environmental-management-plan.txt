\\
===== 2 Context of the Organization =====

\\
==== 2.1 System Description ====
The 20-mile rail system will include 21 stations and will be the heart of Oahu’s multimodal public transportation system.  Plans are to provide initial passenger service between Kapolei and Aloha Stadium in late 2020.  Rail will be fully integrated with the city bus system. A single system-wide transit smart card will be used by passengers to move seamlessly between TheBus and HRTP.  The rail transit system will link the growing region of West Oahu with Daniel K. Inouye International Airport, downtown Honolulu and Ala Moana Center. 

Educational institutions along the alignment include UH-West Oahu, Leeward Community College, Honolulu Community College and Hawaii Pacific University. An extension to UH Manoa can be built at a later date.  

Rail transit will be powered by electricity and benefit from the most promising advances in alternative energy sources, such as solar, wind and biofuels.  The rail system will be operated from the 43-acre LEED certified Rail Operations Center (ROC), which is also where the train fleet will undergo maintenance. The ROC is located between Waipahu High School and Leeward Community College at the Maintenance Storage Facility (MSF).

\\
==== 2.2 Scope of Transit Services ====
The HRTP will provide fully automated, high-speed, public transportation for the people of Oahu with a two-way route from West Kapolei to Ala Moana.  HRTP’s average weekday patronage is expected at 119,600 weekday trips by year 2030.  The System will operate from 4:00am to midnight, with trains arriving about every five minutes during peak travel times and about every 10 minutes during non-peak hours.  The Department of Transit Services (DTS) for the City & County of Honolulu, which also operates TheBus, will be the operator of the HRTP and has been designated as the Rail Transit Agency (RTA).  TheBus will be integrated with the rail system offering intermodal transit options in Waipahu, Pearl City (Pearl Highlands), Middle Street, and Ala Moana.

\\
==== 2.3 Alignment ====
The HRTP rail alignment follows a right-of-way fully grade-separated from roadway operation, with grade-level facilities at the MSF and the Leeward Community College station, which are fully fenced.  The operating system consists of 20 miles of double track, from East Kapolei and going to Ala Moana, with an electrified third rail.

There are twelve (12) rail crossovers at various locations along the guideway with a pocket track at the Aloha Stadium station to permit turn-backs, single tracking, or storage.  Crossovers are spaced so that continuous service can be maintained in each direction between most crossovers using only one track.  Trains can be operated bi-directionally under fully automatic train control.  The System also includes 13 traction power substations and 2 gap breaker stations.

[{{:hsqe:environmental:procedure:hnl-09022-f01.jpg?600|Figure 1 - Overview of HRTP Alignment}}]

=== 2.3.1 Section I – West O'ahu/Farrington Highway: East Kapolei to Aloha Stadium ===
East Kapolei is the western terminus of the Project. The alignment begins at Kualaka'i Parkway (formerly North-South Road) north of Kapolei Parkway. The alignment follows Kualaka'i Parkway in a northerly direction to Farrington Highway, where it turns east following Farrington Highway and crosses Fort Weaver Road. The alignment is elevated along Kualaka'i Parkway and along Farrington Highway. 

The alignment continues along Farrington Highway as an elevated structure. South of the H-1 Freeway, the guideway descends to grade as it enters the Rail Operations Center located at the former Navy Drum Site. The alignment continues at grade to Leeward Community College and then returns to an elevated configuration to cross over the H-1 Freeway. The alignment then turns eastward along Kamehameha Highway. 

The Rail Operations Center (ROC) is located on 43 acres of land at the former Navy Drum site, east of Farrington Highway and to the south of Leeward Community College, providing service and storage for the PVs. 
Section I includes nine stations: East Kapolei, UH West O'ahu, Ho'opili, West Loch, Waipahu Transit Center, Leeward Community College, Pearl Highlands, Pearl Ridge and Aloha Stadium. In addition, it includes two park-and-ride lots and one bus transit center. 

\\
=== 2.3.2 Section II – Kamehameha Highway: Pearl Highlands to Aloha Stadium ===
The alignment remains elevated and continues in the median of Kamehameha Highway, crossing H-1 and continuing to where the Moanalua Freeway extension joins Kamehameha Highway at Aiea Stream. The route then crosses the westbound land of Kamehameha Highway and continues to the Aloha Stadium Station, followed by a pocket track. Section II includes three stations: Pearl Highlands, Pearlridge, and Aloha Stadium. It also includes one park-and-ride structure, one bus transit center, and one park-and-ride lot. 

\\

===== 3 Environmental Strategy =====
HRH has reviewed and analyzed key aspects of itself and its stakeholders to determine the strategic direction of the company. This involves:

  * Understanding our core Services, and scope of management system.

  * Identifying “interested parties” (stakeholders) who may be impacted by our services and activities, or those parties who may otherwise have a significant interest in our company. The process for identifying these is described in the Interested Parties Procedure, those interested parties identified are recorded in the Interested Parties Register.

  * Understanding internal and external issues that are of concern to HRH and its interested parties; also identified in the Interested Parties Register. Many such issues are identified through an analysis of environmental aspects, impacts, risks and opportunities affecting either HRH or the interested parties. Such issues are monitored and updated as appropriate and discussed as part of management reviews.

This information is then used by senior management to determine the company’s strategic direction. This is defined in records of management review, and periodically updated as conditions and situations change. 

HRTP plays an important role in managing the environmental impacts of transport in the City and County of Honolulu by providing a service which reduces road congestion and, as a result, carbon emissions and other air pollutants. 

However, while HRTP can improve the quality of the urban environment and provide a low carbon transport option, it is recognized that DTS and therefore HRH must also manage the impact of its operations on the environment. 

Good environmental practice relies on an understanding of the environmental implications of our operations and maintenance being fully embedded into our day-to-day and planning activities. 
HRH’s environmental strategy includes:

  * Managing carbon and energy use – as a significant consumer of electricity, efficiencies wherever they can be found will result in a decrease in electricity consumption. Electricity consumption is a significant contribution to climate change, and we have a responsibility to ensure that we use energy efficiently.  We will use renewable energy to the extent it is available.

  * Improving resource use and waste management - A wide variety of wastes are produced as a consequence of operating and maintaining the HRTP. These wastes include customer waste, station and depot waste and waste associated with station, track and infrastructure maintenance. Through the optimization of lifecycle costs and adhering to commissioning recommendations we aim to progressively reduce the amount of waste associated with our activities, to recycle more and to increase the proportion of waste we recycle through a recyclable materials program.

  * Managing noise - Operating a railway can result in noise and vibration which may be a nuisance to people living or working near our railway lines, stations or depots. Certain activities such as maintenance works are an essential element of operating a railway. Keeping customers safe and informed is an important part of operating a world-class public transport network. However, we want to ensure that noise nuisance is minimized wherever possible.

  * Air quality - Limiting gaseous emissions from all sources including direct emissions from motor vehicles and indirectly through the reduction in electricity consumption. 

  * Managing potential pollution - The broad nature of our activities means that there is potential to cause pollution or damage to the environment. Therefore, we will have standards which outline how we will reduce toxic materials including by the use of biodegradable cleaning products, how materials should be stored and managed on our network and we will monitor the control of pollution during maintenance activities.

  * Water Management – Water must be well managed, both minimizing use, reducing losses and protecting against pollution. 

\\
===== 4 Scope of the Management System =====

\\
==== 4.1 Scope Statement ====
Based on an analysis of the above issues of concern, interests of stakeholders, and in consideration of its Services, HRH has determined the scope of the management system as follows:

Operation and Maintenance of the Honolulu Rail Transit Project

\\
==== 4.2 Facilities Within the Scope ====
The environmental management system applies to all processes, activities, and employees of the following locations within the company:

\\
===== 5 Environmental Policy =====
The Honolulu Rail Transit Project (HRTP) plays an important role in managing the environmental impacts of transport in the City and County of Honolulu by providing a service which reduces road congestion and, as a result, carbon emissions and other air pollutants. However, while HRTP can improve the quality of the urban environment and provide a low carbon transport option, it is recognized that HRH must also manage the impact of its operations on the environment. We are committed to operating and maintaining the HRTP in a way that minimizes negative impacts to people, property and the environment.

We believe that in addition to regulatory and contractual obligations, it is our moral obligation to ensure that meeting the needs of the present should not compromise the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This includes the way in which our operation and maintenance of the HRTP impacts the environment. 

We expect all staff to participate in environmental management. We must all participate, thinking about the tasks we undertake, assessing and understanding their impact on the environment and seeking continuous improvement. We must require the same of subcontractors and suppliers and spread our environmental culture.

We are committed to providing the highest standards of environmental management. We aim to deliver this by:

  * Maintaining full compliance with all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations, as well as client and other environmental requirements;

  * Embedding the concept of sustainability into HRH’s staff and subcontractors’ culture by involving them in environmental issues

  * Identifying significant direct and indirect environmental issues for all sites and monitoring their impacts

  * Implementing all measures to prevent environment pollution, including to groundwater,

  * Implementing environmental indicators for a straight‐forward monitoring of performance,

  * Improving environmental performance through the regular review of activities and processes 

  * Promoting environmental benefits and positive aspects to the community through awareness & cooperation.

To achieve our commitments, we will:

  * Develop, implement and maintain an effective Environmental Management System and processes; and

  * Identify areas for continuous improvement through KPIs, audits and investigation.

All staff have a role to play in delivering excellent environmental performance, we will ensure that all staff are committed, have clear responsibilities for the environment and are competent to deliver them.

==== 7.1 Environmental Aspects, Impacts, Risks, and Opportunities ====
HRH will implement processes to identify the environmental aspects of its activities and services that it can control and those that it can influence. This includes those aspects which have potential for positive impacts on the environment, in addition to those which have potential for negative impacts.

These aspects will be assessed to determine the scope and magnitude of their impact (positive and negative); the controls and mitigations that should be implemented in case of significant negative impacts; and the measures to maximize, whenever reasonably practicable, the identified positive impacts.

HRH will identify the environmental aspects within their defined scope of control and influence, taking into account the inputs and outputs (both intended and unintended) associated with their activities and services. Aspects can be:

  * Direct: Activities over which the organization can be expected to have an influence and control; or

  * Indirect: Actual or Potential activities over which the organization can be expected to have an influence, but no control. For example, supply chain-controlled aspects, customer-controlled aspects, etc.

Environmental aspects and impacts, under normal working conditions, abnormal (i.e. planned but infrequent) and reasonably foreseeable emergency situations (floods, fires, accidents, etc.) will be considered

Aspect Categories include:

  * Emissions to Air

  * Emissions to Water

  * Emissions to Land

==== 7.4 Dealing with Emergencies ====
HRH recognizes that despite best efforts, the possibility of environmental incidents or emergency situations will exist. Effective preparation and response can reduce environmental impacts, protect employees and neighbors, reduce asset losses and cleanup costs, and minimize downtime.

As such effective emergency preparedness arrangements have been developed and are described in [[hsqe:emergency-management:procedure:hnl-09007-emergency-management-plan|HNL-09007]] Emergency Management Plan.

\\
==== 7.5 Waste Management ====
In support of HRH’s ongoing efforts to minimize costs, control liability, and maintain a sound environmental program, every effort will be made to minimize the generation of waste. To accomplish this objective, various methods have been identified, including:

  * Careful evaluation of the need to purchase chemicals to begin with, and then only if other alternatives are not available;

  * Purchasing Control - purchase materials only in amounts required for use in planned activities. 

  * Periodic Inventory Evaluation;

  * Environmental Management - Make every effort to reduce the volume of the solid waste stream, reduce the toxicity of the solid waste stream, increase re-use and recycling efforts; and

  * Bulk materials whenever possible to maximize disposal cost efficiency.
Details are provided in HNL-09661 Waste Management Procedure.

=== 7.5.1 Waste Stream Identification ===
HRH will identify all waste streams resulting from its activities and will record this information on a Waste Streams Register. This process will be led and facilitated by the Environmental Compliance Officer (ECO) with the participation of relevant persons with technical knowledge and responsibility in the area being assessed. 

The ECO will review the Waste Streams Register as necessary (e.g. change in legislation) but as minimum on an annual basis in conjunction with the Environmental Aspects and Impacts Register 

For each identified waste stream, the Register will record as minimum:

  * Generating activities/sources (general and specific)

  * Description of the waste stream

  * If the waste stream is direct or indirect

  * Waste stream classification:

  * Form (solid, liquid, etc.)

  * Quantity/volume (to be) produced in a quarter 

  * Handling and storage method

  * Treatment method (if applicable)

  * Disposal arrangements

  * Reference to the Compliance Obligations Register, if applicable

  * Responsible department/department head

All identified waste streams will be controlled for compliance with relevant legislation and managed to minimize the risk of: 

  * Personal Injury 

  * Infection / illness to person/s 

  * Damage to the environment (air, land or water) 

  * Prosecution and damage to company reputation 

  * Imposed fines and cleanup costs 

\\
=== 7.5.2 Waste Management Arrangements ===
HRH will ensure that suitable waste management arrangements are in place for the different classifications of wastes identified and recorded on the Waste Streams Register.

Specific segregation, storage, handling and disposal instructions and control measures for each waste stream and materials will be identified in the Waste Streams Register and detailed in the relevant control procedures and processes
The ECO will inspect waste accumulation and waste storage areas regularly to ensure compliance with housekeeping, waste accumulation and segregation requirements detailed in the Waste Streams Register. 

\\
=== 7.5.3 Disposal ===
The Contracts Manager has the overall responsibility for the management of the Waste Management Contracts. However, advice will be sought from the functional heads and the ECO as required

Disposal of hazardous wastes may only be undertaken by an EPA licensed Treatment / Storage / Disposal Facility by a waste hauler who has a state or local license and U.S. EPA identification number. 

Waste pick-up/removal schedule/frequency will be determined as per the characteristics of each waste stream, their quantities, and the size of the storage/garbage rooms at each facility. 

\\
==== 7.6 Environmental Performance Evaluation ====
\\
=== 7.6.1 Monitoring, Measurement, Analysis and Evaluation ===
HRH will establish, implement and maintain processes to monitor and measure, on a regular basis, the key characteristics of its operations that have a significant environmental impact. This will include documenting information to monitor performance, applicable operational controls and conformity with HRH’s environmental objectives and targets. Areas that will be covered include:

•	Energy consumption

•	Water consumption

•	Waste management & disposal

•	Discharges

•	Pollution incidents

•	Audit and inspection results

•	Noise

•	Complaints and other non-conformances

\\
=== 7.6.2 Environmental Audit ===
HRH will develop an Audit Process for assessing compliance with the Environmental Management System.

A comprehensive system of planned and documented internal audits aimed at evaluating the conformance of the system or process to planned arrangements and compliance with applicable legal requirements, as appropriate, shall be carried out on a periodic basis by competent, impartial and objective auditors that are independent of the processes being audited.

\\
==== 7.7 Management Review ====
The Senior Management Team shall, at regular intervals, review the Environmental management system. This review will address the possible need for changes in policy, objectives or other elements of the management system in light of audit results and changing circumstances. Inputs to the management review process will include:

  * Follow up actions: ensuring actions arising from previous reviews been completed;

  * Assessing results of audits, inspections and post incident reports;

  * Relevant communication(s) from external interested parties, including complaints;

  * Evaluation environmental performance;

  * Evaluation of sub-contractor performance;

  * Status of incident investigations, corrective actions and preventive actions;

  * Changing circumstances, including developments in legal and other requirements;

  * Recommendations for improvement coming from the previous Management Reviews and External/Employer/Third Parties.

Outputs from management reviews include:

  * The status of environmental performance;

  * The status of policy and compliance;

  * Decisions related to changes;

  * Objectives for improvement.

==== 7.8 Document Control and Record Keeping ====
HRH will maintain all environmental records including but not limited to:

  * Training Records;

  * Permits; 

  * Waste manifests / bills of lading

  * Inspection reports

  * Testing reports

  * Tank system monitoring reports

  * Discharge monitoring reports

  * Spills / releases and corrective action. 

Copies of all environmental program management records shall be submitted to DTS.
