===== 2 Occupational Health Hazards =====
\\
==== 2.1 Overview ====
Occupational health hazards cause harm to the systems of the human body over long periods of time.  These chronic effects are not easily seen and sometimes are only discovered through medical health surveillance.

The following are examples of health hazards which apply to HRH activities:

  * Chemical Hazards from exposure to hazardous substances

  * Biological Hazards from exposure to bacteria, viruses, bites and stings from animals and blood borne pathogens

  * Physical Hazards from lifting, carrying, pushing, and pulling, repetitive movements (e.g. use of keyboards or workshop equipment), extreme temperatures and humidity, strong sunlight, noise, and vibration

  * Psychosocial Hazards including occupational stress and fatigue

\\
==== 2.2 Identification of Occupational Health Hazards ====
Occupational Health hazards will be identified in one of the following ways:

\\
=== 2.2.1 Proactive Identification ===
Proactive identification methods include:

  * Occupational Risk Assessment - Occupational health hazards will be identified through the risk assessment process described in the HNL-09640 Occupational Risk Assessment Procedure, supported by specific risk assessment protocols e.g. Fatigue Risk.

  * Safety tours / inspections - Line Managers may identify potential health issues while carrying out safety tours or inspections as described in HNL-09634 Safety Tours and Planned General Inspection procedure.

  * Employee concerns and feedback – Employees shall raise any concerns about any health hazard associated with their work via the [[hsqe:safety:procedure:hnl-09023-accident-and-incident-procedure|HNL-09023]] Accident and Incident Notification, Reporting and Investigation procedure or the HNL-09648 Good Faith Challenge Work Instruction.

\\
=== 2.2.2 Reactive Identification ===
Reactive identification of occupational hazards may come from:

\\
=== 2.2.3 Medical Examinations ===
Safety Sensitive Employees are required to undergo medical examination as detailed in the HNL-09102 Fitness for Duty Procedure, to establish their state of health and/or fitness to work at various times including:

  * Pre-employment medical examinations - to establish a baseline medical history and identify any health issues that may be pre-existing or become worse by exposure to any of the existing or anticipated health hazards in the workplace

  * Routine medical examinations – to identify any new performance or conduct affecting conditions or monitor ongoing performance or conduct affecting conditions.

  * Specific medical examinations – which, when carried out to investigate an injury or illness, may identify an occupational health hazard as the cause.

\\
=== 2.2.4 Incident/Accident reports ===
Any injury or illness sustained at or as a result of work that requires the employee to take time away from their normal duties will be reported as described in the [[hsqe:safety:procedure:hnl-09023-accident-and-incident-procedure|HNL-09023]] O&M Provider - Accident and Incident Notification, Reporting and Investigation Plan.

\\
=== 2.2.5 Sickness Reporting ===
Line Managers will review all sickness reports and meeting notes from ‘Return to normal duties’ interviews for any work related issues and report these to HR.  HR will inform the HSE Department of any reported absence due to work related injuries or diseases.
 
\\
===== 3 Controlling Hazards =====
All health hazard assessments will be carried out by competent assessors with advice from the HSE team.

Below are the anticipated areas of risk for HRH that will be assessed to determine whether there is/are any occupational health issues.

\\
==== 3.1 Chemical and Biological hazards ====
Hazards associated with exposure to hazardous substances will be managed through the application of the HNL-09649 Hazardous Materials Management Procedure.

Specific controls related to exposure to bodily fluids and blood-borne pathogens are described in the [[hsqe:safety:procedure:hnl-09629-medical-and-first-aid-procedure|HNL-09629]] Medical and First Aid Procedure.

\\
==== 3.2 Physical Hazards ====
\\
=== 3.2.1 Manual Handling ===
Where work tasks involve any lifting, carrying, pushing, or pulling of loads an assessment of the impact on the employee’s health will be carried out.  The assessment will take account of the load, the frequency of operation, the equipment available to assist the handling and the capabilities of the individuals involved.  Assessments will be undertaken using with the HNL-09690 Manual Handling Risk Assessment Form.

Work patterns designed to keep exposure to a safe level and the use of mechanical aids such as trolleys, hoists and overhead cranes are typically used to control the risks.

\\
=== 3.2.2 Noise ===
Where noise levels are above 80dB(A) in the workplace a noise at work assessment will be carried out by the HSE team.  Generally, this will be when a ‘normal’ conversation cannot be conducted at a range of 2m without raising the voice. Line Managers will request an assessment for all noise at or above this level.  

The initial approach to controlling noise risk will be to seek an engineering solution to reduce the noise at source.  When engineering solutions have been exhausted or are no longer practicable, exposure will be reduced by designing suitable work patterns and practices.  If these two approaches are not successful suitable hearing protection will be selected with advice from the HSE Department to control exposure to the noise.

\\
=== 3.2.3 Working Outdoors ===
Where employees are required to work outdoors for extended periods in high temperatures and humidity, Line Managers will assess the impact on their health.  The effects will be controlled by simple task rotation or the wearing of protective clothing or sunscreen creams so far as is reasonable.

\\
==== 3.3 Psycho-Social Hazards ====
\\
=== 3.3.1 Occupational Stress ===
Line Managers will remain vigilant for signs of occupational stress in their employees. If significant signs are observed the Line Manager will refer the case to the Occupational Health Provider for further investigation.

\\
=== 3.3.2 Fatigue ===
Shift Patterns will be subject to risk assessment as described in the HNL-09102 Fitness for Duty Procedure. Line Managers will remain vigilant for signs of fatigue in their employees. If significant signs are observed the Line Manager will refer the case to the HSE Department for further investigation.

Line Managers in collaboration with HR will ensure that work routines are designed as far as possible to reduce fatigue and stress.

\\
==== 3.4 Other Health Hazards ====
Where other occupational health hazards are identified the HSE team will investigate, make an assessment and if necessary, arrange for specialist assistance as required.

\\
==== 3.5 Health Surveillance ====
Where employees are unavoidably exposed to a known risk of occupational ill-health, such as high noise levels, they will be referred to the Occupational Health Service provider for regular examination.
 
\\
===== 4 Information, Instruction & Training =====
\\
==== 4.1 Campaigns ====
The HSE Department will instigate educational programs and awareness campaigns about significant health hazards in the workplace and promoting a healthy lifestyle in general.

These campaigns will follow the principles set out in the [[hsqe:safety:procedure:hnl-09607-hsqe-communications-procedure|HNL-09607]] Communications procedure.

The progress and effectiveness of such campaigns will be monitored regularly, and the findings posted on the H&S Notice Boards in all workplaces and fed back to employees in Line Manager briefing sessions or Team meetings.

\\
==== 4.2 Training ====
Where formal training is required it will be arranged by the Training department.
Line Managers will ensure that where reinforcement of safe working practice is required ‘Toolbox Talks’ are given at the start of a shift.  
 
===== 5 Hazard, Incident and Accident Reporting =====
HRH uses both continuous hazard identification methods and periodic, targeted hazard identification campaigns. This approach utilizes a number of methodologies including:

  * Reports generated by automated systems (see HNL-09613 Monitoring, Measurement and Reporting Procedure)

  * Observations made by operational personnel (see [[hsqe:safety:procedure:hnl-09023-accident-and-incident-procedure|HNL-09023]] O&M Provider - Accident and Incident Notification, Reporting and Investigation Plan, [[hsqe:safety:procedure:hnl-09652-workforce-involvement-procedure|HNL-09652]] Workforce Involvement Procedure and HNL-09648 Good Faith Challenge Work Instruction

  * Results from vehicle and facilities maintenance audits and inspection, both pre-service and periodic (see HNL-09634 Planned General Inspections and Leadership Tours Procedure)

  * Daily review of HRH Daily Operations Log (see HNL-09613 Monitoring, Measurement and Reporting Procedure)

  * Findings and recommendations from internal safety and security audits (see HNL-09616 IMS Audit Procedure)

  * Formal hazard analyses (Preliminary Hazard Analysis, Failure Mode and Effects Analysis, Operations Hazard Analysis, Fault Tree Analysis) through the development and maintenance of the Operations Hazard Log (See HNL-09637 System Risk Management Procedure)
 
\\
==== 7 Procurement =====
The Procurement Department will ensure health hazards are taken into account in the procurement process for work equipment, materials, and services.  The HSE Department will be consulted on the selection and purchase of any new machine, equipment, or material for use by HRH employees and only approved supplies will be purchased.

Line managers will ensure contractor employees do not introduce any new machine, equipment or materials into the workplace that creates a new health hazard or increases the negative effect of an existing health hazard.  Should this occur the Line Manager will escalate the matter for investigation.

Hitachi Rail Honolulu (HRH) is committed to protecting current and former employees and applicants for employment from interference and retaliation when making protected disclosures, or “whistleblowing,” which includes disclosing information related to: a violation of law, rule, or regulation; gross mismanagement; gross waste of funds; abuse of authority; or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.  

The Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 and Hawaii law, HRS § 378-62  protect individuals who report misconduct from retaliation. 

HRH will initiate appropriate actions against responsible persons who take, threaten to take, or fail to take a personnel action with respect to any employee, former employee, or applicant for employment because of any protected disclosure of information.  

HRH will not tolerate whistleblower retaliation.  Legitimate disclosure of information by employees is an invaluable resource for the oversight of our operations.  I expect that employees are able to report these matters confidentially. 

I am committed to maintaining HRH’s position as a Company that respects the rights of current and former employees and applicants for employment to raise legitimate concerns without fear of retaliation.
