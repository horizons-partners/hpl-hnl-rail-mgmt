===== 1 Scope =====

\\ 

==== 1.1 Purpose ====

The purpose of this procedure is to establish a standard for verbal safety communication within HRH and to develop a compliance framework to monitor performance and ensure the adoption of this method of communication as best practice in all verbal communication and therefore reduce the risk of error in a safety sensitive environment.

\\ 

==== 1.2 Applicability ====

This procedure is applicable to all staff (directly employed or otherwise) working on HRH Controlled Infrastructure; however formal competence assessments will generally only be carried out where required by specific competence standards.

===== 2 Safety Critical Communications =====

A protocol for communicating in a safety critical environment is maintained and published for use by all staff. The protocol is included as Annex A.

HRH staff and contractors are expected to use this whenever communicating safety critical messages. They are also encouraged to adopt the protocol as good practice for all verbal communications.

\\ 

===== 3 Training =====

Staff will receive training in safety communications required for their particular role. Training in safety communications shall address:

  * Understanding of the importance and consequences of miscommunications

  * The correct operation of communications equipment applicable to roles and responsibilities.

  * Competence and knowledge

  * Practical exercises and simulation covering: \\ o Normal, degraded and emergency operations \\ o Misinterpretation \\ o Unclear responses \\ o Incorrect responses \\ o Ambiguous responses

Reviews of training will be carried out by the Training department on a regular basis. The review will also take in to account any lessons learnt from accidents and incidents where communications were cited as a factor.

\\ 

===== 4 Competence Monitoring =====

In addition to the requirements of the Competence Standard, OCC staff will be subject to monitoring, both formally and informally, announced and unannounced, in accordance with the requirements in Table 1.

The record of the monitoring shall be included in the individual’s competence record.

\\ 

**Table 1 - OCC Safety Critical Communications Monitoring**

^ Who ^ Monitored by ^ Frequency ^ Method ^
| OCC Supervisor | Operations Manager | Each postholder shall be subject to monitoring at least once every 3 months | Analysis of voice recording or direct observation |
| Controller | OCC Supervisor | ::: | ::: |

Non-OCC staff shall be monitored by Competence Management assessment.

During the monitoring of OCC staff, any observations made regarding the non-OCC party must be reported to the individuals’ line manager.

Targeted monitoring shall be put in place above and beyond the requirements in Table 1 where there is evidence of unsatisfactory performance.

Guidance on assessing Safety Critical Communications is included in Annex B.

\\ 

===== Annex A Safety Critical Communications Protocol =====

==== Giving and Receiving Messages ====

=== General Instructions ===
Messages that may affect safety must always be properly given and understood. You must carry out these instructions when giving or receiving such messages.

<WRAP info 60%>//**Note**// \\ //Where possible, communicate safety critical messages verbally, this allows you to check that the message has been received and understood.//</WRAP>

You must be prepared to write down any instructions given; this will help when repeating information back.

If the person you are talking to responds or speaks in an accent or dialect which is unfamiliar, take time to make sure your message is understood and that you understand the other person’s message

\\ 

=== Leading the Conversation ===
One person must always take responsibility for leading the communication.

<WRAP info 60%>//**Note**// \\ //The table below gives examples of who will normally have responsibility for leading a conversation//

{| style="background:white;border:1px solid #ccc;padding:1em"
|+ 
! style="border:1px solid #ccc;padding:0.5em" |

//Station Supervisor//
| style="border:1px solid #ccc;padding:0.5em" |
//Station staff//
|}
</WRAP>
\\ 
The person with lead responsibility must:
  * Make sure that both parties have come to a complete understanding
  * Correct errors in the repeat back until the message is fully understood. 

If it is not clear who has lead responsibility, or if two people carrying out the same task are communicating, the person who begins the conversation must take the lead responsibility.

The person with the lead responsibility is the only person permitted to end a conversation. They must do so by saying the word ‘out’.

\\ 
=== Giving Messages ===
You must make sure:
  * You are talking to the right person and that person knows who you are
  * Your message is Accurate, Brief and Clear (ABC)
\\ 
To make your message as clear as possible you must:
  * speak clearly and use short sentences at the same volume as you would in a normal conversation
  * use words and phrases that the person you are talking to will understand
  * spell words that are difficult to say or understand by using the phonetic alphabet
  * try to avoid hesitation sounds (for example ‘um’ and ‘er’) and slurring one word into another
\\ 
You must start your message by:
  * saying who you are (name and job title) and where you are calling from
  * asking who you are talking to
  * saying why you are calling
\\ 
Before finishing the conversation, you must:
  * get the person to repeat the message back to you
  * check it has been properly understood
  * know how to make contact again (if required)

<WRAP important 60%>

=== Saying Numbers ===
If you are using numbers in your message, you must:
  * say them one at a time, not all together
  * say the number ‘0’ as ‘zero’

<WRAP info 60%>//**Note**// \\ //For example, ‘123’ must be spoken ‘one two three’ not ‘one hundred and twenty three’.//</WRAP>

You do not need to apply this method of quoting numbers when you refer to times, weights and measurements

<WRAP info 60%>//**Note**// \\ //For example, the time 13:17 hours should be spoken as ‘thirteen seventeen hours//</WRAP>


\\ 
==== Making an Emergency Call ====

\\ 
=== Emergency Calls ===

Any emergency must immediately be reported to the OCC

<WRAP info 60%>//**Note**// \\ //You must always start your message with the phrase// \\ <typo fs:larger>**//‘Emergency, Emergency, Emergency’//**</typo> </WRAP>

You must then tell the controller:
  * your name
  * your job title
  * where you are speaking from
  * the nature and exact location of the emergency
  * whether it is necessary to stop trains from moving
  * whether the traction power supply needs to be switched off
  * whether the emergency services are or may be needed
  * how you can be contacted

You must make sure that your message is repeated back to confirm it has been correctly understood.

You must wait for further instructions from the controller.

\\ 
=== Short Codes ===

Short codes may be used as a way of alerting staff on board and to the OCC about important information either onboard the train or affecting the system.

You may use short codes to provide this important information in such a way that it does not alarm or alert the public to the nature of the incident, so that you are able to remain in control of the situation.

The short codes to be used are as follows:

^ Code ^ Meaning ^
| //Code Alpha// | Assistance for staff required (from other staff or security guards) |
| //Code Bravo// | Bomb threat |
| //Code Papa// | Police required |
| //Code Foxtrot// | Fire | 
| //Code Mike// | Medical Assistance required |

These do not replace emergency calls but are used to get help or assistance in a discreet way, e.g. if you needed the police to attend but you did not want the person there to know you were calling the Police (they may run away) you would say "this is a Code Papa".

===== Annex B Guidance for Assessing Safety Critical Communications =====

When reviewing each conversation an assessment must be made of compliance with the Safety Critical Communications Protocol in Annex A.

^ Assessment ^ Description ^
| Very good | All of the communications protocols have been followed.\\The communication was concise, polite and a clear understanding was reached. |
| Good | The individual(s) reached a clear understanding and followed the majority of the protocols including taking lead responsibility. |
| Satisfactory | The individual(s) reached a clear understanding and followed the majority of the protocols concerning starting the communication correctly and ensuring the message was understood through the use of repeat backs. |
| Poor | Some attempt to use the protocols but with significant variations and with a possibility of misunderstandings occurring. |
| Very poor | No attempt has been made to use the communications protocols. Likelihood of misunderstandings occurring very high. |
