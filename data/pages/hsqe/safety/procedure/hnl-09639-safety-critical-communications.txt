===== 1 Scope =====

\\ 

==== 1.1 Purpose ====

The purpose of this procedure is to establish a standard for verbal safety communication within HRH and to develop a compliance framework to monitor performance and ensure the adoption of this method of communication as best practice in all verbal communication and therefore reduce the risk of error in a safety sensitive environment.

\\ 

==== 1.2 Applicability ====

This procedure is applicable to all staff (directly employed or otherwise) working on HRH Controlled Infrastructure; however formal competence assessments will generally only be carried out where required by specific competence standards.

===== 2 Safety Critical Communications =====

Spoken and written communication can be critical in maintaining safety. This can include general communications in the form of safety information, communications between team members or between different teams during operations or maintenance work, and emergency communications.

A protocol for communicating in a safety critical environment is maintained and published for use by all staff. The protocol is included as Appendix 1.

HRH staff and contractors are expected to use this whenever communicating safety critical messages. They are also encouraged to adopt the protocol as good practice for all verbal communications.
 

\\ 
===== 3 Training =====

Staff will receive training in safety communications required for their particular role. Training in safety communications shall address:

  * Understanding of the importance and consequences of miscommunications

  * The correct operation of communications equipment applicable to roles and responsibilities.

  * Competence and knowledge

  * Practical exercises and simulation covering:\\ o	Normal, degraded and emergency operations\\ o	Misinterpretation\\ o	Unclear responses\\ o	Incorrect responses\\ o	Ambiguous responses

Reviews of training will be carried out by the Training department on a regular basis. The review will also take in to account any lessons learnt from accidents and incidents where communications were cited as a factor.

\\ 
===== 4 Competence Monitoring =====
In addition to the requirements of the Competence Standard, OCC staff will be subject to monitoring, both formally and informally, announced, and unannounced, in accordance with the requirements in Table 1.

The record of the monitoring shall be included in the individual’s competence record.

**Table 1 - OCC Safety Critical Communications Monitoring**

^ Who ^ Monitored by ^ Frequency ^ Method ^
| OCC Supervisor | Head of Operations | Each postholder shall be subject to monitoring at least once every 3 months | Analysis of voice recording or direct observation |
| Controller | OCC Supervisor | ::: | ::: |

Non-OCC staff shall be monitored by Competence Management assessment.

During the monitoring of OCC staff, any observations made regarding the non-OCC party must be reported to the individuals’ line manager.

Assessments may be made of a recorded sample of communications or by direct observation using the checklist in Appendix 2. Where poor communication is identified, corrective action must be identified and recorded / tracked in the individuals log. Copies of these assessments shall be held in individuals training file:

Targeted monitoring shall be put in place above and beyond the requirements in Table 1 where there is evidence of unsatisfactory performance.

==== Giving and Receiving Messages ====

=== General Instructions ===
Messages that may affect safety must always be properly given and understood. You must carry out these instructions when giving or receiving such messages.

<WRAP info 60%>//**Note**// \\ //Where possible, communicate safety critical messages verbally, this allows you to check that the message has been received and understood.//</WRAP>

You must be prepared to write down any instructions given; this will help when repeating information back.

If the person you are talking to responds or speaks in an accent or dialect which is unfamiliar, take time to make sure your message is understood and that you understand the other person’s message

\\ 

=== Leading the Conversation ===
One person must always take responsibility for leading the communication.

<WRAP info 60%>//**Note**// \\ //The table below gives examples of who will normally have responsibility for leading a conversation//

{| style="background:white;border:1px solid #ccc;padding:1em"
|+ 
! style="border:1px solid #ccc;padding:0.5em" |

//Train & Stations Supervisor//
| style="border:1px solid #ccc;padding:0.5em" |
//Station staff//
|}
</WRAP>
\\ 
The person with lead responsibility must:
  * Make sure that both parties have come to a complete understanding
  * Correct errors in the repeat back until the message is fully understood. 

If it is not clear who has lead responsibility, or if two people carrying out the same task are communicating, the person who begins the conversation must take the lead responsibility.

The person with the lead responsibility is the only person permitted to end a conversation. They must do so by saying the word ‘out’.

\\ 
=== Giving Messages ===
You must make sure:
  * You are talking to the right person and that person knows who you are
  * Your message is Accurate, Brief and Clear (ABC)
\\ 
To make your message as clear as possible you must:
  * speak clearly and use short sentences at the same volume as you would in a normal conversation
  * use words and phrases that the person you are talking to will understand
  * spell words that are difficult to say or understand by using the phonetic alphabet
  * try to avoid hesitation sounds (for example ‘um’ and ‘er’) and slurring one word into another
\\ 
You must start your message by:
  * saying who you are (name and job title) and where you are calling from
  * asking who you are talking to
  * saying why you are calling
\\ 
Before finishing the conversation, you must:
  * get the person to repeat the message back to you
  * check it has been properly understood
  * know how to make contact again (if required)

<WRAP important 60%>
//**Warning**// \\ //You must not start, or allow others to start any safety sensitive activity to start unless a complete understanding has been reached// \\ \\ //Safety sensitive activities include, but are not limited to://

  * Movement of trains
  * Setting up and operating permits to work or possessions
  * Carrying out repair or maintenance work
  * Switching traction current
  * Any other activity where the safety of those involved could be affected
</WRAP>

\\ 
=== Receiving Messages ===
You must make sure that you:
  * give your name, role and location
  * understand who the caller is
  * understand the information and any action that is required
  * repeat the message to the caller
