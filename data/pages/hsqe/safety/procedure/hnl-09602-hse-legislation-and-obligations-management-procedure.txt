===== 2 Legislation and Obligations Register ===== 

HRH maintains the HNL-09603 Legislation and Obligations Register to record and manage the committed obligations (legislative and other requirements) applicable to the activities of the business and to which it subscribes. 

Each requirement within the HNL-09603 Legislation and Obligations Register must contain the following information as minimum:

  * Field of Application

  * The name of the Legal or Other Obligation

  * Summary of the specific requirements of each obligation that HRH must comply with

  * Details of how HRH verifies compliance

  * The status of the obligation

  * Any Actions required

\\


===== 3 New or Altered Requirements ===== 

New or altered requirements (legislative or committed) may be identified from a number of sources, including:

  * Regulatory Notices (Federal or State)

  * Subscriptions

  * Internet sources

  * Stakeholder management meetings

  * Legal advice

  * New or altered interested parties / stakeholders

  * Management Review Meetings

  * Feedback from employees

  * Results of internal and external audits

All new or altered requirements must be identified to the Safety and Security Manager.

Once a new requirement (legal or committed) has been identified, it must be included in the HNL-09603 HSE Legislation and Obligations Register. This will be done by the Safety and Security Manager once alerted to the new requirement.

Legislation and Obligation Requirements will be reviewed by their respective Sponsor (or designate) on a regular basis with a minimum frequency of six months. 

Once a change or update of an existing requirement within the Register has been identified, the Legislation and Obligations Register must be updated as well. This will be done by the Safety and Security Manager or his delegate once alerted to the new requirement.

When a significant change is identified, it must be progressed in accordance with the HNL-09619 Management of Change Procedure. This process will ensure that all affected departments of the organization and all affected documentation (Plans, Procedures, Work Instructions, Forms, Environmental Aspects and Impacts, Competences, Job Descriptions etc.) are identified in response to the change.

Communications related to any update in the Legislation and Obligations Register will be done as per the Document Control Procedure.
