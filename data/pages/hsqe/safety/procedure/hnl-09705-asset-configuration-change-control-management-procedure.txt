===== 1 Scope =====

==== 1.1 Purpose ====

The purpose of this procedure is to:

  * Provide a consistent and structured approach to asset configuration control management throughout the asset lifecycle.

  * Describe the Configuration baseline on-boarding, which consists of the configuration transition from the D&B phase to the O&M phase of the project.

  * Describe the configuration tracking and maintenance during the O&M phase

  * Set out the methods of controlling the configuration of all the fixed and moving assets used on the HRTP for the operation and maintenance of the train service, with the objectives of ensuring that the railway is safe, that any changes to the assets are made under controlled conditions, that the status of all assets which could affect the safety of passengers, staff and the general public is known and the railway is operated effectively  

\\
==== 1.2 Applicability ====

This procedure supports HRH’s [[hsqe:quality:procedure:hnl-09619:management-of-change-procedure|HNL-09619]] Management of Change Procedure. It outlines the requirements for the identification and control of changes that materially affect the HRTP assets.

This procedure applies to all parties working on the HRTP who intend to introduce changes to the configuration which may affect the safety and performance of the HRTP asset.

This procedure requires that all configuration changes and applications be systematically recorded and any configuration change proposals that may affect the safe operation of the railway must be subject to an impact assessment review prior to their implementation.  This is to ensure that proper identification of safety risks and controls is established during and after configuration changes are implemented. This is a necessary feature of the HRH safety regime.  

Control of configuration applies equally to new works, as it does to any alteration of the existing assets.  It is expected however that where configuration changes are proposed by parties external to HRH, then they must also make arrangements for a thorough review prior to submission of their application under this procedure.

Note: The assessment and justification of changes to the configuration or those requiring safety certification will require HRH RAMS involvement and the relevant Certification Authority. The evidence of this activity must then be presented to HRH as part of this procedure to ensure that the implications of such changes to the O&M of the HRTP are understood and acceptable to HRH and that the Asset Register is maintained.

\\
===== 3 Configuration Baseline on Boarding =====

The baseline of configuration is determined by the D&B Organization as described in HNL-02200 Configuration Management Plan, in accordance with the rules defined in HNL 02013 – Quality Implementing Procedure - AHJV Guide for Object Identification. At the completion of the Testing and Commissioning stage, for each subsystem, a baseline is established and provided to the O&M Organization.

As a minimum, it is expected that the baseline will contain, for each subsystem:

  * Sites/Locations

  * List of all hardware configuration items for each location

  * List of all software configuration items for each location

For each hardware configuration item, the following will be identified:

•	OIC

  * Description

  * Supplier

  * Supplier part number

  * Manufacturer

  * Manufacturer part number

  * Hardware revision (if applicable)

  * Serial number (where required)

For each software configuration item, the following will be identified:

  * Software description

  * Software version

  * Software release

The aforesaid baseline will be then imported into the MMIS system and kept up to date over the duration of the O&M contract. 

\\
===== 4 Configuration Tracking and Maintenance =====

Whatever change in hardware or software configuration item will be managed according to the process outlined in section 5. Of course, the subject process excludes ordinary replacements to be performed as part of the corrective maintenance regime, where a component is replaced with an identical one (new or repaired). However, each corrective maintenance work order that has been resolved through component replacement will contain information about the newly installed serial number and about the removed serial number. Subsequently, the MMIS is updated to reflect serial numbers installed on the system.

\\
==== 4.1 Configuration Audits ====

The Engineering and Asset Manager shall plan and prepare Configuration audits. The audit shall determine, for each subsystem and location to what extent the actual configuration reflects the physical and functional characteristics available on records (i.e. technical documentation and MMIS). The audit plans shall include at least:

  * Configuration items under review

  * Audit procedures

  * Participants

  * Required technical documentation

  * Procedure to record deficiencies

  * Pass/fail criteria
 
===== 5 Configuration Change Management =====

==== 5.1 Links to the HRH Change Management Process ====

All changes are subject to HNL-09619 Management of Change Procedure.

Where a proposed change is identified in Part 1 of the submitted and accepted HNL-09620 Initial Impact Assessment Form as being a technical change, the Initial and Detailed Impact Assessment shall be undertaken, reviewed, and endorsed under the requirements of this ACCC Process.

The conclusions of the ACCC Process applied to the change shall be submitted to the Change Control Committee for final review and approval.
\\
==== 5.2 Asset Register and System Configuration Baseline ====

The asset register contained within the MMIS shall be utilized as the master configuration structure for each system comprising the railway and shall initially be in accordance with the physical asset and systems at launch of service.  

The asset register shall include all elements of a system represented in a hierarchical manner and according to a structured naming convention and version numbering control system.  These established conventions shall be owned by the Asset Owners and utilized to provide guidelines on setting a configuration baseline for a system upon completion of major changes, consisting of sources of all configuration items that represent the definition of the asset and / or product of a particular version.

Each Asset Owner is responsible for maintenance of the asset register for their associated asset base and also creating a backup copy of the configuration baseline which can be used as the source for future modification or used for regeneration of the system from the baseline if necessary.
