===== 2 Planned General Inspections =====

====2.1 General ====
All Managers have a duty to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of the staff under their control. They also have a duty to ensure that aspects and impacts that could impact the environment are effectively managed. To facilitate this, routine monitoring of staff activities, staff facilities and worksites and the effective recording non-conformances is essential. The manager must therefore have in place a robust regime based upon the principals outlined below. 

Planned General Inspections (PGI’s) are in addition to routine pre-opening Station Inspections.

Although the content of this procedure is focused on planned inspections and leadership tours, the principles, purpose, methods, and records described may be used for unannounced inspections and tours that are not part of the planned program.

\\
====2.2 Formulation of Checklist ====
The Manager shall ensure that a site-specific checklist is compiled for each of the locations for which he / she is responsible.

Consideration must be given to monitoring both unsafe acts and unsafe conditions. The items listed in Section A of the HNL-09635 Planned General Inspection Form, require compulsory checks. Other issues for consideration are listed in Section B of the form and would be included for inspection where relevant.

==== 2.3 Planning of Inspections ====
A program for PGIs must be compiled annually by the relevant manager to ensure that all sites under their control are visited at least three-monthly (quarterly). Managers may determine that additional inspections are necessary based on their knowledge of the location, accident, and incident trends, works planning etc. 

Arrangements should be made 5 days in advance, to ensure that local staff are aware of the date of the inspection and will be able to assist / participate, as necessary. Where operationally possible, the local HSE Representative may be invited to attend PGIs.

\\
====2.4 Conducting of Inspections ====
Whilst carrying out PGIs, managers must identify deficiencies that may affect either the safe, reliable operation of the railway or the environmental impacts resulting from the deficiency and ensure that all safety and environmental precautions are uncompromised (e.g. fire doors not blocked or wedged open, spill containment in place) and equipment available (e.g. first aid box seals intact).

When inspecting a workplace/site particular attention should be paid to areas or equipment that gives rise to added risks, e.g. stairways, lifts, escalators, places with restrictive access and egress, places with slipping/tripping hazards and areas were hazardous substances are used.

The following guiding principles must be followed when discovering a hazard. Assumptions must not be made and, if unsure, advice should be sought from the HSE Department if necessary:

  * Do not presume that someone else has reported it.

  * Make it safe immediately

  * Prevent access by employees and customers to the affected area if necessary

  * Report it at the earliest opportunity

  * Resume normal services only when it is safe to do so

  * Keep a note of events and times for the report

  * Complete an Incident Report Form if hazard is considered to be/have been of a significant nature

\\
==== 2.5 Recording of Findings ====
A formal record of the PGI must be prepared using the PGI Form.

Where safety or environmental non-conformances are noted during an inspection they must be recorded and categorized in accordance with HNL-09623 Management of Hazards and Non-Conformances Procedure.

A non-conformance is defined as the non-fulfilment of a requirement, inspections and tours may identify safety or environmental non-conformances such as acts or conditions that are non-fulfilments of safety or environmental plans, procedures, or instructions.

\\
==== 2.6 Follow Up ==== 
Where an infrastructure / facilities defect is identified, the person identified to ensure that follow up action is taken, shall utilize the normal maintenance and repair procedures.

The manager shall be responsible for ensuring that a system is in place to monitor that follow up action is taken within the timescales. Where actions are not undertaken in a timely manner, the local manager should escalate the issue via their respective Line Manager / Director.

\\
===== 3 Leadership Tours =====
\\
====3.1 General ====
Leadership Tours are intended to demonstrate clear, visible, and personal leadership and commitment to HSE and to understand human factors affecting HSE performance focusing on where accidents are likely to happen and what can be done to prevent them.
The objectives of the Leadership Tour program are:

  * Increase safety awareness

  * Provide local management and staff with a visible and practicable indication of the Senior Management commitment to HSE matters

  * Provide the opportunity for Directors / Managers to engage in two-way communications with staff members about HSE matters

  * See conditions as they exist in the workplace and facilities used by customers and employees

  * Improve the overall safety culture in the organization

\\
==== 3.2 Preparation for a Leadership Tour ====
Prior to undertaking a Tour, the Director / Manager will prepare a summary of outstanding actions from previous Audits, Inspections and Tours for the location(s) to be visited. Assistance can be sought from the HSE Department.

\\
==== 3.3 Planning of Leadership Tours ====
The HSE Manager will ensure a program of Leadership Tours is developed each year that covers all locations adequately. Directors will agree an annual program of the Tours to ensure the required commitment and participation of the business management team is fulfilled. The completed program will be tracked, and progress reported in the HSE Steering Committee.

Directors / Managers should consider conducting tours that will be outside of “normal office hours”. 

Directors and Managers should ensure their tours are carried out at a variety of times during a working day to ensure they see any differences between shifts and should focus on strategic HSE issues that support the key elements of HSE improvement plans.

Arrangements should be made to ensure that local staff are aware of the date of the Tour will be able to assist / participate, as necessary. Where operationally possible, the local HSE Representative may be invited to attend Tours.

\\
==== 3.4 Conducting a Leadership Tour ====
Sufficient time should be allowed for discussions with staff, observation of acts/conditions and spot checks of relevant documentation. Listed below is good practice for conducting an effective Tour:

  * It is anticipated that a thorough Leadership Tour will take a minimum of 2 hours

  * Ensure full compliance with all Procedures and Work Instructions whilst carrying out Tours. For example, don’t go into restricted areas without a valid Permit as required by the infrastructure access procedures, wear the correct Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), always follow the directions of the person in charge of the work, etc.

  * The tour party should receive a safety briefing from the person in charge of the work / location detailing hazards, limits of access and communication arrangements.

  * Observe staff working for a short while before talking to them. Always talk to people in a place of safety. Take care not to create a risk by interrupting safety sensitive work

  * Ask open questions rather than looking for hazards or issues. The objective is to get staff members to personally recognize the need to upgrade their safety performance. Discussions should be skillfully guided but not manipulative. A selection of sample questions and subjects are attached at Appendix 1.

  * The discussion should be open, honest, and direct but not argumentative or confrontational. The discussion has to be a mutual learning experience

  * Take action PERSONALLY on any problems you find as far as you can. You may seek advice or guidance from others, such as the HSE team, but you must take responsibility for ensuring any actions are taken forward and closed out

  * Where you identify actions for others, these must be discussed and agreed before writing them into the report

  * Ensure any faults observed are logged as per the Fault Reporting procedure by the manager responsible for the site

  * Provide feedback, there and then, on positive as well as negative things you have found. Also, provide feedback to the Local Manager (if he/she wasn’t with you) and/or their manager where appropriate, particularly to commend good practice

  * Check ownership of pre-existing conditions/faults and not re-report

  * Leadership Tours should not become the basis for disciplinary action. 

Where possible, staff should be observed carrying out their normal duties and notes made of positive observations as well as non-conformances. 

\\
====3.5 Recording Findings ====
The person who completes the leadership tour should document the findings on the HNL-09636 Leadership Tour Report Form.

Reports should be written up within 24 hours and the ownership and timescales for any actions arising should be agreed with the actionees before submitting the report to HSE.

\\
====3.6 Items of Concern Raised in the Report will be Recorded as Hazards, Observations, or Non-Conformances in Accordance with PRC 045 - Non Conformity, Corrective Actions, and Improvement Plans Follow Up ====	
The HSE Manager shall monitor compliance with the program and any identified trends and report progress against it to the HSE O&M Steering Committee.
