\\
===== 11 Lockout Procedure =====

==== A. Sequence of Lockout ====
 
The following are specific procedures to be followed for lockout by the Qualified Person. 

1.	Notify the Maintenance Manager that is responsible for the equipment.

2.	Obtain a copy of the machine specific energy control procedure for use during equipment shutdown. (Appendix A)

3.	Notify HRH Safety, through AHA with attached Single Line Drawing, of the simple LOTO. 

4.	Notify all affected employees that lockout is going to be utilized and the reason why. 

5.	If the machine/equipment is in operation, shut it down by the normal shutdown procedure. 

6.	Operate the appropriate switch, valve, etc., so that the machine/equipment is isolated from the energy source. 

7.	Lock the energy isolating devices, using assigned locks and danger tags. 

8.	Release, restrain, or dissipate any stored energy. 

9.	Verify that energy isolation is complete, by attempting to start the affected machinery or equipment in the normal manner. 

10.	After testing, return all operation controls to the "neutral" or "off" positions.
 
\\
==== B. Restoration to Normal ====
 
1.	After service or maintenance is complete, check the area to ensure that no employees are exposed. 

2.	Remove all tools and repair equipment. 

3.	Ensure that all guards have been replaced and all safety interlocks reactivated (if so equipped). 

4.	Verify that the operating controls are in the "off" or neutral position. 

5.	Remove all lockout and tag devices and activate the energy isolation devices to restore energy. 

\\
==== C. Procedure Involving More than One Person ====

In the preceding steps, if more than one individual is required to lockout or tagout equipment, each shall place his/her own personal lockout device or tagout device on the energy isolating device(s). When an energy-isolating device cannot accept multiple locks or tags, a multiple lockout or tagout device (hasp) may be used. If lockout is used, a single lock may be used to lock out the machine or equipment with the key being placed in a lockout box 5 or cabinet, which allows the use of multiple locks to secure it. Each employee will then use his/her own lock to secure the box or cabinet. As each person no longer needs to maintain his/her lockout protection, that person will remove his/her lock from the box or cabinet. 

If servicing of equipment lasts more than one work shift, lockout/tagout protection must not be interrupted. Employees completing their shift and preparing to leave the facility must not remove their lock until the next employee to service the equipment is ready to lock out. 

When an employee who applied a lock is not there to remove it, the “two person rule” will be enacted. The lock may be cut only in the presence of the work area supervisor. Before allowing the lock to be cut, the supervisor will account for all employees working in the area. 

A report of the emergency procedure outlining the details must be furnished to Safety Manager within 24 hours. The report must include the name of the employee who placed the lock on the equipment and the names of the employee and supervisor who removed the lock.

\\
===== 12 Program Inspection and Review =====

At least annually, the Head of Safety will verify the effectiveness of the energy control procedures. These inspections shall provide for a demonstration of the procedures and may be carried out through random audits and observations. 

The Head of Safety, or designee, will review the Hazardous Energy Control Procedure with all authorized employees and actually observe the use of the procedure. This inspection will be certified and documented by the Head of Safety, or designee.  These inspections are to ensure that the energy control procedures are being properly used and to provide a check on the continued adherence to the procedures. Head of Safety, or designee, will certify that the prescribed inspections have been performed.  Any deficiencies will be corrected immediately, either by modification of the procedure, retraining of employees, or a combination of both.

\\
===== 13 Outside Contractor =====

Outside personnel or contractors involved in lockout of equipment or machinery that affects our employees must submit their energy control procedures, in writing, to the Head of Safety for acceptance. All affected employees must be trained in and familiar with the contractor's submitted procedure. 

In order to protect our employees, the contractor's work area will be isolated, and access by our employees will be restricted. If this is impractical or cannot be accomplished, the Head of Safety must assure the contractor's compliance with proper work procedures, energy isolation procedures and contractor employee compliance. 

Contractors failing to adhere to the provisions of the OSHA Hazardous Energy Control standard, HIOSH Regulations, and HRH O&M Provider Safety plan will be asked to terminate their work until their program is brought into compliance.
