=== 1.5 Description of Changes from the Previous Revision === 

Second issue, in response to HART Review Cycle A comments.

\\
 
===== 2 Overview ===== 

It is a condition of employment that all safety-sensitive employees comply with the Policy contained within this program and FTA Regulations.

The purpose of the policy is to advise safety-sensitive employees of their obligations under federal law and of HRH policy prohibiting the use of illegal drugs on or off duty and prohibiting the use of alcohol on duty or misuse alcohol off duty in a manner that may affect their performance on duty. The policy sets out the consequences if a safety-sensitive employee does not comply and discusses drug and alcohol tests and testing procedures required by federal law. Finally, this program describes educational, training, and assessment programs available to HRH employees. 

This Program and Policy will apply to all employees who perform or may be expected to perform a “safety sensitive function” as per Regulations. In addition, the Policy will apply to all employees regardless of whether or not they are considered a safety-sensitive employee. HRH reserves the right to drug and alcohol test any HRH employee, including managers and supervisors, if there is a reason to believe they may be unfit for duty due to the use of prohibited drugs and/or alcohol.

Contractors employed by HRH shall be required to implement and a Drug and Alcohol Policy that is compliant with the requirements of this Program.

The goal and objective of this Program and Policy is to ensure that HRH can provide safe and dependable transportation services by assuring that employees are not impaired in their ability to perform assigned duties in a safe manner.

\\
 
===== 3 HRH Drug and Alcohol Policy Statement =====

HRH is dedicated to providing safe and dependable transportation services to its patrons. HRH employees are a valuable resource and it is also our goal to provide a safe, healthy, and satisfying working environment for our employees.
 
In meeting these goals, it is our policy to:

  * Assure that employees are not impaired in their ability to perform assigned duties in a safe, productive, and healthy manner

  * Create a workplace environment free from the adverse effects of drug and alcohol abuse or misuse

  * Prohibit the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of controlled substances

  * Encourage employees to seek professional assistance when substance abuse adversely affects their ability to perform their assigned duties.

Each employee shall be provided a signed copy of the adopted policy.

\\
 
===== 4 Covered and Non-Covered Employees =====

Portions of this instruction are not FTA -mandated but reflect HRH’s instruction. These additional provisions are identified by italic text. Non-covered employees are defined as HRH employees who are not covered by FTA “safety-sensitive function” definition.

All covered and non-covered employees are required to submit to drug and alcohol tests as a condition of employment in accordance with 49 CFR Part 655.

All HRH employees are subject to the provisions of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988.

The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession or use of a controlled substance is prohibited in the covered workplace. An employee who is convicted of any criminal drug statute for a violation occurring in the workplace shall notify Human Resources no later than five days after such conviction.

\\
 
===== 5 Prohibited Behavior ===== 

Use of illegal drugs is prohibited at all times. All covered and non-covered employees are prohibited from reporting for duty or remaining on duty any time there is a quantifiable presence of a prohibited drug in the body above the minimum thresholds defined in Part 40. Prohibited drugs include:

  * marijuana

  * cocaine

  * phencyclidine

  * opiates

  * amphetamines

All covered employees are prohibited from performing or continuing to perform safety-sensitive functions while having an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater. All non-covered employees are prohibited from performing work functions while having an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater.

All covered employees are prohibited from consuming alcohol while performing safety-sensitive job functions or while on-call to perform safety-sensitive job functions. If an on-call employee has consumed alcohol, they must acknowledge the use of alcohol at the time that they are called to report for duty. If the on-call employee claims the ability to perform his or her safety-sensitive function, he or she must take an alcohol test prior to performance.  

All covered employees are prohibited from consuming alcohol within four (4) hours prior to the performance of safety-sensitive job functions. 

All covered employees are prohibited from consuming alcohol for eight (8) hours following involvement in an accident or until he or she submits to the post-accident drug and alcohol test, whichever occurs first.

\\

 
===== 6 Consequences for Violators ===== 
Following a positive drug or alcohol (BAC at or above 0.04) test result or test refusal, the employee will be immediately removed from safety-sensitive duty and referred to a Substance Abuse Professional (SAP). 

Following a BAC of 0.02 or greater, but less than 0.04, the employee will be immediately removed from safety-sensitive duties for at least eight hours unless a retest results in the employee’s alcohol concentration being less than 0.02. 

HRH has a zero-tolerance instruction.

  * any employee who tests positive for drugs or alcohol (BAC at or above 0.04) or 

  * refuses to test, or

  * convicted of any criminal drug statute for a violation occurring in the workplace

will be referred to a Substance Abuse Professional (SAP) and terminated from employment.

\\


===== 7 Circumstances for Testing =====

\\


=== 7.1 Pre-Employment Testing === 

HRH elects to conduct pre-employment alcohol testing.  In doing so, HRH shall comply with the following requirements:

  * Pre-employment alcohol tests shall be conducted before the first performance of safety-sensitive functions by every covered employee (whether a new employee or someone who has transferred to a position involving the performance of safety-sensitive functions).

  * All covered employees performing safety-sensitive functions shall be treated the same for the purpose of pre-employment alcohol testing (i.e., all covered employees shall be tested).

  * Pre-employment tests shall be conducted after making a contingent offer of employment or transfer, subject to the employee passing the pre-employment alcohol test.

  * Pre-employment alcohol tests shall be conducted using the alcohol testing procedures set forth in 49 CFR Part 40.

  * HRH shall not allow a covered employee to begin performing safety-sensitive functions unless the result of the employee's test indicates an alcohol concentration of less than 0.02.

A negative pre-employment drug test result is required before an employee can first perform safety-sensitive functions. If a pre-employment test is cancelled, the individual will be required to undergo another test and successfully pass with a verified negative result before performing safety-sensitive functions. A negative pre-employment drug test is required before a non-covered employee can perform work duties. 

If a covered employee has not performed a safety-sensitive function for 90 consecutive calendars days and has not been in the random testing pool during that time, the employee must take and pass a pre-employment test before he or she can return to a safety-sensitive function. 

A covered employee or applicant who has previously failed or refused a DOT pre-employment drug and/or alcohol test must provide proof of having successfully completed a referral, evaluation, and treatment plan meeting DOT requirements.

\\


=== 7.2 Reasonable Suspicion Testing === 

All covered and non–covered employees shall be subject to a drug and/or alcohol test when HRH has reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee has used a prohibited drug and/or engaged in alcohol misuse. A reasonable suspicion referral for testing will be made by a trained supervisor or other trained company official on the basis of specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech, or body odors of the covered employee.

Covered and non-covered employees may be subject to reasonable suspicion drug testing any time while on duty. Covered employees may be subject to reasonable suspicion alcohol testing while the employee is performing safety-sensitive functions, just before the employee is to perform safety-sensitive functions, or just after the employee has ceased performing such functions.

Reasonable suspicion alcohol tests shall be conducted within two (2) hours of a determination for the need to test, or documentation shall be provided as to why the testing was not performed within two (2) hours. If a test is not conducted within eight (8) hours of such a determination, it shall not be conducted at all. 

\\


=== 7.3 Post-Accident Testing === 

Post-accident testing is done as a part of the requirements outlined in HNL-09023 Accident and Incident Notification, Reporting and Investigation procedure. 

Covered employees shall be subject to post-accident drug and alcohol testing under the following circumstances:

  * Fatal Accidents

As soon as practicable following an accident involving the loss of a human life, drug and alcohol tests will be conducted on each surviving covered employee operating the public transportation vehicle at the time of the accident. In addition, any other covered employee whose performance could have contributed to the accident, as determined by HRH using the best information available at the time of the decision, will be tested.

  * Non-fatal Accidents

As soon as practicable following an accident not involving the loss of a human life, drug and alcohol tests will be conducted on each covered employee operating the public transportation vehicle at the time of the accident if at least one of the following conditions is met:

  * The accident results in injuries requiring immediate medical treatment away from the scene, and the covered employee may have contributed to the accident

  * One or more vehicles incurs disabling damage and must be towed away from the scene, and the covered employee may have contributed to the accident

In addition, any other covered employee whose performance could have contributed to the accident, as determined by HRH using the best information available at the time of the decision, will be tested.

The determination of contribution to an accident will be made by the Head of HSE (or his deputy) using the information available to them at the time. The decision to undertake such tests will be recorded in the OCC Log.  Examples of such contributions to an accident may include a Controller who gives an exceedance of authority instruction leading to an accident or a maintenance supervisor authorizing a vehicle as fit for service which is subsequently involved in an accident.

A covered employee subject to post-accident testing must remain readily available, or it is considered a refusal to test. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the delay of necessary medical attention for the injured following an accident or to prohibit a covered employee from leaving the scene of an accident for the period necessary to obtain assistance in responding to the accident or to obtain necessary emergency medical care.

Post-accident alcohol tests shall be conducted within two (2) hours of a determination for the need to test, or documentation shall be provided as to why the testing was not performed within two (2) hours.

\\


=== 7.4 Random Testing === 

Random drug and alcohol tests are unannounced and unpredictable, and the dates for administering random tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year. Random testing will be conducted at all times of the day when safety-sensitive functions are performed.

Testing rates will meet or exceed the minimum annual percentage rate set each year by the FTA administrators. The current year testing rates are 50% random drug testing, and 10% random alcohol testing.

The selection of employees for random drug and alcohol testing will be made by a scientifically valid method, such as a random number table or a computer-based random number generator. Under the selection process used, each covered employee will have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made. 

A covered employee will only be randomly tested for alcohol misuse while the employee is performing safety-sensitive functions, just before the employee is to perform safety-sensitive functions, or just after the employee has ceased performing such functions. A covered employee may be randomly tested for prohibited drug use anytime while on duty. HRH covered employees on-duty while they perform safety sensitive functions and while they are on-call. The on-call status and schedule are determined by their Manager. 

Each covered employee who is notified of selection for random drug or random alcohol testing must immediately proceed to the designated testing site. 

Random testing may occur anytime an employee is on duty so long as the employee is notified prior to the end of the shift. Employees who provide advance, verifiable notice of scheduled medical or childcare commitments will be random drug tested no later than three hours before the end of their shift and random alcohol tested no later than 30 minutes before the end of their shift. Verifiable documentation of a previously scheduled medical or childcare commitment, for the period immediately following an employee’s shift, must be provided at least 4 Testing Procedures (four) hours before the end of the shift.

\\
 
===== 8 Testing Procedures ===== 

All FTA drug and alcohol testing will be conducted in accordance with 49 CFR Part 40, as amended.

  * Dilute Urine Specimen 

If there is a negative dilute test result, HRH will accept the test result and there will be no retest, unless the creatinine concentration of a negative dilute specimen was greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL, but less than or equal to 5 mg/dL. 

Dilute negative results with a creatinine level greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL but less than or equal to 5 mg/dL require an immediate recollection under direct observation (see 49 CFR Part 40, section 40.67).

  * Split Specimen Test

In the event of a verified positive test result, or a verified adulterated or substituted result, the employee can request that the split specimen be tested at a second laboratory. HRH guarantees that the split specimen test will be conducted in a timely fashion. HRH will pay for the test.

\\
 
===== 9 Test Refusals ===== 

A covered employee is considered to have refused to test if they:
 
1)	Fail to appear for any test (except a pre-employment test) within a reasonable time, as determined by HRH. 

2)	Fail to remain at the testing site until the testing process is complete. An employee who leaves the testing site before the testing process commences for a pre-employment test has not refused to test. 

3)	Fail to attempt to provide a breath or urine specimen. An employee who does not provide a urine or breath specimen because he or she has left the testing site before the testing process commenced for a pre-employment test has not refused to test. 

4)	Fail to permit monitoring or observation of your provision of a specimen, in the case of a directly observed or monitored urine drug collection.

5)	Fail to provide a sufficient quantity of urine or breath without a valid medical explanation. 

6)	Fail or decline to take a second test as directed by the collector or HRH for drug testing. 

7)	Fail to undergo a medical evaluation as required by the MRO or HRH’s Designated Employer Representative 

8)	Fail to cooperate with any part of the testing process. 

9)	Fail to follow an observer’s instructions to raise and lower clothing and turn around during a directly observed test. 

10)	Possess or wear a prosthetic or other device used to tamper with the collection process. 

11)	Admit to the adulteration or substitution of a specimen to the collector or MRO.  

12)	Fail to remain readily available following an accident. 

13)	As a covered employee, if the MRO reports that you have a verified adulterated or substituted test result, you have refused to take a drug test. 

14)	As a covered employee, if you refuse to take a drug and/or alcohol test, you incur the same consequences as testing positive and will be immediately removed from performing safety-sensitive functions and referred to an SAP

\\
 
===== 10 Voluntary Self-Referral =====

Any employee who has a drug and/or alcohol abuse problem and has not been selected for reasonable suspicion, random or post-accident testing or has not refused a drug or alcohol test may voluntarily refer her or himself to the Human Resources Department who will refer the individual to a substance abuse counsellor for evaluation and treatment. 

The substance abuse counsellor will evaluate the employee and make a specific recommendation regarding the appropriate treatment. Employees are encouraged to voluntarily seek professional substance abuse assistance before any substance use or dependence affects job performance. 

HRH offers a confidential Employee Assistance Program (EAP) to employees who may be struggling with drug and alcohol abuse problems. 

Any safety-sensitive employee, (anyone who works on the train, track or OCC), who admits to a drug and/or alcohol problem will immediately be removed from his/her safety-sensitive function and will not be allowed to perform such function until successful completion of a prescribed rehabilitation program.

\\
 
===== 11 Prescription Drug Use ===== 

The appropriate use of legally prescribed drugs and non-prescription medications is not prohibited. However, the use by safety sensitive employees of any substance which carries a warning label that indicates that mental functioning, motor skills, or judgment may be adversely affected must be reported to the Human Resources Department. Medical advice should be sought, as appropriate, while taking such medication and before performing safety-sensitive duties. 

For questions about HRH’s anti-drug and alcohol misuse program, contact HRH Human Resources Department.

\\

 
===== 12 Record Keeping =====

Employee drug and alcohol test results are strictly confidential. The MRO, the laboratory, and the HRH Human Resources Department are the sole custodians of all original paperwork and records pertaining to the test results. Employee test records must be maintained in confidence as provided in FTA Regulations. Substance abuse testing information is kept in a locked confidential file, separate from the employee’s general personnel file.

HRH may disclose information related to a positive drug/alcohol test of an individual to the individual or the decision maker in a lawsuit, or other proceeding initiated by, or on behalf of the individual and arising from a certified positive test. Employee test results will not be released to anyone else without the written consent of the tested party, except as required by law. Employees must sign a release when requesting their own test results.
All requests for test records must be submitted in writing to HRH Director – Operations and Maintenance. FTA-regulated employees may request copies of their own drug and alcohol records including laboratory records.
