\\ 

===== 2 Introduction =====


\\ 

==== 2.1 Safety Management System ====

On July 6, 2012, President Obama signed into law P.L. 112-141, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21). MAP-21 created a streamlined, performance-based, and multimodal program to address the many challenges facing the U.S. transportation system including: improving safety and maintaining infrastructure condition. Under MAP-21, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) requires the development of an SMS approach to railway safety management. The SMS approach requires a formal, top-down, organization-wide approach to managing safety risk and assures the effectiveness of safety risk mitigation. SMS includes systematic procedures, practices, and policies for managing risks and hazards, including developing:

  * An accountable safety organization

  * Strong safety culture

  * Proactive hazard analysis

  * Performance measures and leading indicators

  * Formal data collection

  * Voluntary reporting

  * Continuous learning and communications

SMS is a management approach that ensures that HRH has the necessary organizational structures, accountabilities, policies, and procedures in place to direct and control resources for safety management. SMS builds on the public transportation industry’s existing safety foundation to mitigate safety risk better, detect and correct safety problems earlier, share and analyze safety data more effectively, and measure safety performance more accurately. 

DTS and HRH have adopted and are committed to implementing the SMS principles. This OMSP has been prepared to be in compliance with the DTS TARSP, 49 CFR 673 and HDOT’s State Safety Oversight Program Standard.
The OMSP is organized according to the four components of SMS, mainly:

  * **Safety Management Policy** – HRH’s documented commitment to safety, which defines the safety objectives and the accountabilities and responsibilities of employees regarding safety.

  * **Safety Risk Management** - The processes for identifying hazards and analyzing, assessing, and mitigating safety risk.

  * **Safety Assurance** - The processes that function to ensure the implementation and effectiveness of safety risk mitigation, and to ensure that HRH meets or exceeds its safety objectives through the collection, analysis, and assessment of information.

  * **Safety Promotion** - The combination of training and communication of safety information to support SMS as applied to HRTP.

\\ 

==== 2.2 OMSP Control and Update Procedures ====


\\ 

=== 2.2.1 Review of Initial Submission ===

DTS will submit its TARSP and all referenced materials to HDOT in electronic format 365 calendar days prior to beginning passenger service operations. Supporting material, including this OMSP and its referenced procedures will be submitted as hard copies via mail or email. Once the initial TARSP is approved by HDOT, it will be adopted by the City Council and implemented by the DTS.

\\ 

==== 2.2.2 Annual Updated Submittals ====

To ensure consistency between this OMSP and the DTS TARSP, HRH will conduct an annual review and update of this OMSP for review and acceptance by DTS. The timescales for this annual review are as follows:

**Table 1. Schedule for Annual Review of OMSP**

^ Task ^ Responsible Agency ^ Duration ^ Target Date ^

\\ 

=== 2.2.3 OMSP Change Management ===

The HRH Head of HSEQ is responsible for initiating changes to the OMSP when deemed necessary. The HRH Head of HSEQ is responsible for updating the document and will submit to the HSEQ O&M Steering Committee, for review and approval before onward transmission to DTS.

If the HRH Head of HSEQ identifies the change to the OMSP as significant, HRH will submit the revised OMSP to DTS for review; approval (within 30 calendar days of the effective date of the change); and onward communication to the SSOA. Otherwise, minor changes to the document will be submitted with the annual submission.

\\ 

==== 2.3 Project System Description ====

The HRTP is a 20-mile elevated rail line with 21 stations. The Project is scheduled to operate in two phases: Phase I, the initial operating segment, begins in East Kapolei and terminates at Aloha Stadium, and includes the first nine stations, and Phase II, which will extend the rail line to terminate at Ala Moana Center, will add an additional 12 stations. When both phases are complete, the system will connect West O’ahu with downtown Honolulu and Ala Moana Center via Honolulu International Airport. During Phase I, eastbound travel time will be approximately 21.4 minutes, and westbound travel time will be approximately 19.6 minutes. It will take 42 minutes to travel the entire route. The system features modern steel-wheel-on-steel-rail technology powered with electricity by a third rail. Future extensions could serve other parts of West O’ahu, Salt Lake, UH Manoa, and Waikiki.

The DTS TARSP is currently only applicable to the initial operating segment of Phase I: East Kapolei to Aloha Stadium. Once the construction of Phase II: Aloha Stadium to Ala Moana Center is complete and is ready to enter service, DTS will update the TARSP to be comprehensive of the entire Honolulu Rail Transit system. The HRH OMSP is intended to be applicable to the Operation and Maintenance of the HRTP irrespective of the phased introduction into service.

\\ 

=== 2.3.1 Scope of Transit Services ===

The HRTP will provide fully automated, high-speed, rail mass transportation for the people of O’ahu with a single two-way route, from East Kapolei to Aloha Stadium during the initial operating segment, and to Ala Moana Center with the completion of Phase II. The average weekday patronage is expected at 119,600 weekday trips by year 2030. The system will operate from 4:00 am to midnight, with trains arriving approximately every five minutes during peak travel times and approximately every 10 minutes during non-peak hours. DTS, which also operates TheBus, will be the operator of the system. TheBus will be integrated with the rail system and will offer intermodal transit options in Waipahu, Pearl City (Pearl Highlands), Middle Street, and Ala Moana.

\\ 

=== 2.3.2 Infrastructure ===

\\
== 2.3.2.1 Alignment ==

The HRTP rail alignment follows a right-of-way fully grade-separated from roadway operation, with grade-level facilities at the operations yard and the Leeward Community College station, which are fully fenced. The entire operating system consists of 20 miles of double track, starting at East Kapolei and going to Ala Moana, with an electrified third rail.
\\
[{{:hsqe:safety:procedure:hnl-09111-f01.png?600|Figure 1. HRTP Route Map}}]
\\
There are twelve (12) crossovers at various locations along the entire guideway with a pocket track at the Aloha Stadium station to permit turn-backs, single tracking, or storage. Crossovers are spaced so that continuous service can be maintained in each direction between most crossovers using only one track. Trains can be operated on either track under fully automatic train control. The entire system also includes 14 traction power substations (1 in the yard and 13 on the alignment) and 2 gap breaker stations.
\\ 

== 2.3.2.2 Stations ==

There are 21 stations in the entire system, with nine stations in the initial operating segment (Phase I) and 12 additional stations with Phase II. All stations were scaled to accommodate the 4-car consists which total 256 feet in length and includes platform screen gates for safety and security. Passenger stations are constructed of simple three-level modular structures: a ground entrance with ticket vending equipment, entrance/fare gates, electric power equipment rooms and a train platform level for boarding the vehicles.
Stations will be staffed with Station Operators who provide assistance in system usage, fare policy and usage and directional information to patrons as well as emergency service support. In addition, they monitor station facilities for station maintenance and patron safety. Policing policy will be determined by DTS.

Safety and Security features of the HRTP Stations include:

  * Attendants (Station Operators and Security Personnel) 

  * Restrooms in paid fare areas

  * Bicycle racks

  * Ticket vending machines

  * Closed-circuit TV security cameras

  * Interior and exterior safety lighting

  * Platform screen gates (PSGS) 

  * Automated External Defibrillators (AED)

  * Emergency Telephones

  * Blue Light Stations (BLS)

  * Guideway Intrusion Detection

  * Track Safety Protection (TSP) Pushbuttons

  * Access Control and Intrusion Detection

  * Fire Detection and Suppression Systems

  * Full compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990

Several of the stations will also serve as intermodal connection points at UH-West O’ahu, West Loch, Waipahu Transit, Pearl Highlands, Aloha Stadium and Middle Street, with major transfer points with the bus system locally operated by O’ahu Transit Services.  Four park-and-ride lots are located at the East Kapolei, UH-West O’ahu, Pearl Highlands, and Aloha Stadium stations, with the potential for additional sites in the future. A dedicated access ramp will exit from the H-2 freeway directly into the Pearl Highlands station park-and-ride and bus transit center.

=== 2.3.4 Rail Operations Centre (ROC) ===

HRTP rail operations also includes the Rail Operations Center (ROC), formerly known as the Rail Operations Center (ROC), which is located between the Waipahu and Leeward Community College stations, and includes facilities to repair, maintain, clean, and store revenue-service vehicles and MOW equipment and to support the maintenance of the system. The ROC contains four buildings:

  * Operations and Service Building (OSB), where revenue vehicles are repaired as well as housing the Operations Control Center (OCC) and offices for the various departments

  * Train Wash Facility (TWF), where revenue vehicles are cleaned

  * MOW building, which includes some storage room for MOW vehicles along with office space and the Yard Control Bungalow (YCB)

  * Wheel Truing Facility (WTF), which includes the machine to true wheels, which gives the wheels the proper shape for maintenance and eliminate flat spots

[{{:hsqe:safety:procedure:hnl-09111-f03.png?600|Figure 3. Rail Operations Center}}]
\\ 

=== 2.3.5 Traction Power and Train Control ===

The traction power distribution system consists of 14 substations (1 in the yard and 13 on the alignment) and main line track power distribution facilities. The substations are spaced at approximately one and one-half mile intervals along the alignment.

Train Automatic Train Control (ATC) signaling system uses several technologies, such as Microlok, Microcab and fixed track circuits to determine Distance To Go (DTG) which permits the trains to operate at normal speeds while providing: 

 1)	Proper braking and positing of trains for station stops

 2)	Train separation

 3)	Overspeed protection; and 

 4)	Prevents train incursion into interlockings or other areas normally protected by fixed signals.  

The ATC system is monitored primarily by the SCADA system at the OCC, with maintenance personnel able to interface with the system at local Train Control and Communication Rooms (TCCRs).   Even while the train is operated from the console by the Train Operator, the vehicle’s ATC system still enforces 2, 3, and 4, unless the Train Operator initiates the ATC-bypass switch in which the train would be entirely under the control of the Operator.

The communications and security facilities include emergency phones, closed-circuit television (CCTV), and public address and information display systems.

\\ 

=== 2.3.6 Maintenance Vehicles ===

The Maintenance vehicles are utilized to maintain yard and mainline infrastructure. There are 10 different types of vehicles, which are briefly described below:

This commitment is captured in a policy (HNL-09720 Whistleblower Policy)

\\ 

===== 4 SMS Component 2 - Safety Risk Management  =====

\\ 

==== 4.1 INTRODUCTION ====
The Safety Risk Management component is comprised of the processes, activities, and tools that HRH uses to identify and analyze hazards and evaluate safety risks in operations and supporting activities. It allows HRH to carefully examine what could cause harm and determine whether HRH has taken sufficient precautions to minimize the harm, or if further mitigations are needed.

HRH has developed and implemented Safety Risk Management Processes (HNL-09640: Occupational Risk Management Procedure and HNL-09637: System Risk Management Procedure) for all rail-related elements of the public transportation system, comprised of the following activities:

  * Safety Hazard Identification: methods or processes to identify hazards and consequences of hazards (including Transferred Hazards from the Design and Build Contractors).

  * Safety Risk Assessment: establish methods or processes to assess the safety risks associated with identified safety hazards, including an assessment of the likelihood and severity of the consequences of hazards, including existing mitigations, and prioritization of the hazards based on the safety risk.

  * Safety Risk Mitigation: establish methods or processes to identify mitigations or strategies necessary as a result of the agency’s safety risk assessment to reduce the likelihood and severity of the consequences.

  * Safety Risk Tracking and Reporting: establish methods or processes for tracking and reporting safety risks and unacceptable hazards and provide on-going communication to DTS and HDOT

\\
==== 4.2 HAZARD IDENTIFICATION ====

\\
=== 4.2.1 Transferred Hazards from Design and Build ===
In cases where the HRH D&B Contractor proposes that control or mitigation measures for a hazard should be implemented by another party, detail will be provided to HART on a Hazard Transfer Form using the process depicted below:

{{:hsqe:safety:procedure:hnl-09111-f07.png?400|Figure 7. Hazard Transfer Process from HRH D&B Contractor to HRH O&M Contractor}}

The Hazard Transfer Form will also include:

  * Original Code

  * Hazard Description

  * Inherent Risk\\ o Probability\\ o Severity\\ o Risk

  * Source of Hazard

  * Action Required

  * Residual Risk\\ o Probability\\ o Severity\\ o Risk

  * HRH Response

  * HART Response

Where it is proposed that HRH should implement the measure, a copy of the HTF will be provided to HRH. The HTF will be reviewed by the relevant Professional Head(s) who will consider whether it is reasonable and acceptable for HRH to take responsibility for the hazard and  ongoing control and mitigation of any associated risk. Each measure will be reviewed by HRH and will be categorized as defined in Table 6, with the outcome provided in writing to HART.

**Table 6. Hazard Transfer from HRH D&B Contractor to HRH O&M Contractor**
^ Category ^ Definition ^ Remarks ^
| Accepted | HRH agrees that implementation by the O&M Contractor is acceptable and reasonable. | Means of implementation will be documented, including reference to the relevant procedure. |
| Conditionally Accepted | HRH agrees in principle that the measure shall be implemented by the O&M Contractor, but further information or clarification is required, and / or additional design measures should be considered by the system supplier before it is deemed acceptable. | Details of the information required or other conditions that must be met will be documented. Offline discussions will continue to address the caveats / additional requests. Once completed, HTF shall be updated to  Accepted |
| Not Accepted | HRH does not consider it reasonable for the measure to be implemented by the O&M Contractor. | Details of the reasons for it not being acceptable will be documented.\\ Offline discussions will continue to address issues. If agreement cannot be reached a Joint Risk Review Board shall be convened |

HART will review the feedback on each HTF and formalize the hazard transfer process decisions. 

When it has been agreed by all parties that the measure will be implemented by HRH, and evidence of how it will be implemented (e.g. reference to relevant procedure) HART will sign off the HTF and return it to the HRH D&B Contractor.

Where agreement cannot be reached and the issue cannot be resolved, the matter will ultimately be escalated to the a specially convened Joint Risk Review Board chaired by the DTS CSSO and attended by the HRH Head of Safety and Professional Heads (Professional Head is a term used to describe persons who have the skills knowledge and experience to lead a functional area) appropriate to the matters under review.

**Table 7. Hazard Transfer Process – Professional Heads**
^ Functional Area Affected ^ Professional Head ^
| Contracts | Corporate Services and Contracts Manager |
| HSEQ | Head of HSEQ |
| Operations | Head of Operations |
| Engineering and Maintenance | Head of Engineering and Maintenance |

\\
=== 4.2.2 Hazard Management Program ===

HRH identifies hazards though operating experience of the existing and other systems, scenario development, expert opinion, formal hazard analysis techniques, design and other engineering or technical analyses.

All employees are required to participate in the Hazard Management Process but specific responsibilities rest with:

  * Head of HSEQ - directly responsible for the implementation of the Hazard Management Program on behalf of HRH. The program includes:\\ o Developing, updating, and auditing the program\\ o Training all designated employees and its contractors on the hazard management process; and\\ o Documenting and tracking all identified hazards to resolution.

  * Safety and Security Manager - the coordinator and inter-departmental point of contact for the Hazard Management Program.

HRH uses both continuous hazard identification methods and periodic, targeted hazard identification campaigns. This approach utilizes a number of methodologies including:

  * Reports generated by automated systems (see HNL-09613 Monitoring, Measurement and Reporting Procedure)

  * Observations made by operational personnel (see [[hsqe:safety:procedure:hnl-09023-accident-and-incident-procedure|HNL-09023]] O&M Provider - Accident and Incident Notification, Reporting and Investigation Plan, HNL-09652 Workforce Involvement Procedure and HNL-09648 Good Faith Challenge Work Instruction)

  * Results from vehicle and facilities maintenance audits and inspection, both pre-service and periodic (see HNL-09634 Planned General Inspections and Leadership Tours Procedure)

  * Daily review of HRH Daily Operations Log (see HNL-09613 Monitoring, Measurement and Reporting Procedure)

  * Findings and recommendations from internal safety and security audits (see HNL-09616 IMS Audit)

  * Findings and recommendations from external safety audits

  * Formal hazard analyses (Preliminary Hazard Analysis, Failure Mode and Effects Analysis, Operations Hazard Analysis, Fault Tree Analysis) through the development and maintenance of the Operations Hazard Log

HRH will investigate identified hazards in accordance with HNL-09637: System Risk Management Procedure. The extent of the hazard investigation depends on the complexity of the hazard and the preliminary categorization of the hazard.

The HSEQ Department will begin an initial investigation upon notification of the existence of a hazardous condition.

\\

==== 4.3 SAFETY RISK ASSESSMENT: HAZARD EVALUATION AND ANALYSIS ====
Risk assessment determines the acceptability of the risk associated with the identified hazards and involves two primary steps: 

1) Evaluating hazard consequence; and 
2) Evaluating hazard probability

A hazard severity rating will be assigned to a hazard based on the definitions in MIL–STD 882E, Standard Practice for System Safety. It is a subjective determination of the worst case that could be realistically anticipated to result from human error, design inadequacies, component failure, or malfunction. The categorization of hazards will be consistent with risk-based criteria for severity; it reflects the principle that not all hazards pose an equal amount of risk to safety. The Project will follow these criteria.

**Table 8. System Risk Severity Categories**
^ Category ^ Severity Category ^ Mishap Result Criteria ^
| Catastrophic | 1 | Could result in one or more of the following: death, permanent total disability, irreversible significant environmental impact, or monetary loss equal to or exceeding $10M. |
| Critical | 2 | Could result in one or more of the following: permanent partial disability, injuries or occupational illness that may result in hospitalization of at least three personnel, reversible significant environmental impact, or monetary loss equal to or exceeding $1M but less than $10M. |
| Marginal | 3 | Could result in one or more of the following: injury or occupational illness resulting in one or more lost work day(s), reversible moderate environmental impact, or monetary loss equal to or exceeding $100K but less than $1M. |
| Negligible | 4 | Could result in one or more of the following: injury or occupational illness not resulting in a lost work day, minimal environmental impact, or monetary loss less than $100K. |

**Table 9. System Risk Probability Levels**
^ Description ^ Level ^ Specific Individual Item ^ Fleet or Inventory ^
| Frequent | A | Likely to occur often in the life of an item. | Continuously experienced. |
| Probable | B | Will occur several times in the life of an item. | Will occur frequently. |
| Occasional | C | Likely to occur sometime in the life of an item. | Will occur several times. |
| Remote | D | Unlikely, but possible to occur in the life of an item. | Unlikely, but can reasonably be expected to occur. |
| Improbable | E | So unlikely, it can be assumed occurrence may not be experienced in the life of an item. | Unlikely to occur, but possible. |
| Eliminated | F | Incapable of occurrence. This level is used when potential hazards are identified and later eliminated. |

**Table 10. System Risk Assessment Matrix**
|  |  ^ Severity ^^^^
|  |  | Catastrophic | Critical | Marginal | Negligible |
^ Probability | Frequent | <alert type="danger">High</alert>| <alert type="danger">High</alert> | <alert type="warning">Serious</alert> | <alert type="info">Medium</alert>|
^ ::: | Probable | <alert type="danger">High</alert>| <alert type="danger">High</alert>| <alert type="warning">Serious</alert>| <alert type="info">Medium</alert>|

^ ::: | Probable | <alert type="info">Medium</alert>| <alert type="info">Medium</alert>| <alert type="info">Medium</alert>| <alert type="success">Low</alert>|
^ ::: | Eliminated| Eliminated ||||

**Table 11. Risk Tolerance Criteria**
^ Pri ^ Risk Level ^ Acceptability ^ Resolution Requirements ^
| 1 | High | Unacceptable | Correction required |
| 2 | Serious | Undesirable | Correction may be required, HRH / DTS management decision |
| 3 | Medium | Acceptable w/r | With review and documentation by HRH / DTS management |
| 4 | Low | Acceptable | Without review |
| 5 | Eliminated | Acceptable | No action needed |

The results of the risk assessment will be documented in the Operations Hazard Log. Each entry will provide a link between the hazardous event and the defined control and mitigation measures, including reference to relevant procedures or work instructions.

\\
==== 4.4 Safety Risk Mitigation ====

When determining control measures, a simple hierarchy will be applied, i.e. in order of priority:

  * Eliminate hazards through design selection. Ideally, the hazard should be eliminated by selecting a design or material alternative that removes the hazard altogether.

  * Reduce risk through design alteration. If adopting an alternative design change or material to eliminate the hazard is not feasible, consider design changes that reduce the severity and/or the probability of the mishap potential caused by the hazard(s).

  * Incorporate engineered features or devices. If mitigation of the risk through design alteration is not feasible, reduce the severity or the probability of the mishap potential caused by the hazard(s) using engineered features or devices. In general, engineered features actively interrupt the mishap sequence and devices reduce the risk of a mishap.

  * Provide warning devices. If engineered features and devices are not feasible or do not adequately lower the severity or probability of the mishap potential caused by the hazard, include detection and warning systems to alert personnel to the presence of a hazardous condition or occurrence of a hazardous event.

  * Incorporate signage, procedures, training, and PPE. Where design alternatives, design changes, and engineered features and devices are not feasible and warning devices cannot adequately mitigate the severity or probability of the mishap potential caused by the hazard, incorporate signage, procedures, training, and PPE. Signage includes placards, labels, signs, and other visual graphics. Procedures and training should include appropriate warnings and cautions. Procedures may prescribe the use of PPE. For hazards assigned Catastrophic or Critical mishap severity categories, the use of signage, procedures, training, and PPE as the only risk reduction method should be avoided.

==== 4.5 Safety Risk Tracking and Reporting ====

=== 4.5.1 Operations Hazard Log ===
An Operations Hazard Log will be maintained by HRH to record details of all identified hazards for which HRH has responsibility for: 

  * Applying relevant control and mitigating measures directly; or 

  * Supervising or monitoring the application of control and mitigation measures by others.

The Operations Hazard Log includes hazards which have been subject to the Hazard Transfer Process, as well as those additional hazards which are identified through the Hazard Management Process.

Entries in the Operations Hazard Log contain details of the origin of hazard (i.e. which organization it was identified by), the accident it could lead to and details of the measures that will be applied to control and mitigate risk. To ensure effective traceability, reference will be provided to the relevant procedure, work instruction or other document in which the control measure is described. Responsibilities for implementing and maintaining control and mitigation measures will also be included.

Access to the live version of the log will be restricted to the HRH HSEQ Department who will ensure strict version control and maintaining records of changes made.

The Operations Hazard Log is a live document which will be updated as and when necessary to take into account new hazards and changes identified through review of risk assessments or the application of other elements of HRH’s Safety Management System (such as inspections, audits, or investigations).  

The Operations Hazard Log (Hazard Tracking Log) shall be submitted  to the SSOA (via DTS CSSO) by the HRH Head of HSEQ no less than quarterly. The SSOA will review the Operations Hazard Log and forward any questions or requests for information to the DTS CSSO.

\\
=== 4.5.2 External Hazard Reporting ===

\\
== 4.5.2.1 Hazard Reporting to DTS/HDOT ==

The Head of HSEQ will notify the DTS CSSO of all real or potential hazards that are rated as unacceptable according to the criteria stated and have the potential to impact the immediate safety and security of the rail system. At a minimum, HRH will report such hazards to the DTS CSSP for onward transmission to the SSOA point-of-contact within 24 hours or by 5:00 p.m. on the next regular working day following the determination of the unsafe condition. This will include an electronic copy via email or a hard copy via mail of the appropriately completed worksheets, forms or other materials documenting the real or potential hazard.

•	Initial Investigation Report
HRH will submit to the DTS CSSO an electronic copy of the initial investigation report of the unacceptable hazard for onward transmission to the SSOA point-of-contact within seven calendar days of the hazard being reported to the DTS CSSO / SSOA point-of-contact.

•	Status Investigation Reports
HRH will submit to the DTS CSSO electronic copies of status reports of the unacceptable hazard investigation for onward transmission to the SSOA point-of-contact at least monthly until the investigation is completed.

•	Final Investigation Report
Upon completing the investigation of the unacceptable hazard, HRH will prepare and submit to the DTS CSSO an electronic copy of the final report (for onward transmission to the SSOA point of contact) for review and approval. The final report shall include a description of activities, findings, identified causal factors, and CAP(s) (if required). Within 30 calendar days of receiving a report designated as final, the SSOA will review the report. Within 30 calendar days’ acceptance of HRH’s investigation report, the SSOA will issue to the DTS CSSO a written approval of the report. In the event that the SSOA does not accept the report, the SSOA will communicate in writing the area(s) of disagreement or concern. The report will not be considered final until all conditions are met, and the report is approved by the SSOA.

\\
=== 4.5.3 Annual Review of HRH Hazard Management Plan ===
As part of its annual review of this OMSP, HRH in coordination with DTS will conduct an annual review and audit of the Hazard Management Plan (HNL-09637: System Risk Management Procedure). If any changes require revision to this OMSP (and by extension, the TARSP) this will be addressed as per the process described in Section 2.2.

\\
==== 4.6 Management of Change ====
HRH has developed a process for the management of change (HNL-09619 Management of Change Procedure). This process ensure that the implications of changes identified by either HRH or DTS are subject to a process of justification and peer review.

\\
=== 4.6.1 HRH Change Sponsor ===
All changes, irrespective of whether they originate from within HRH or from DTS require an HRH Change Sponsor. The HRH Change Sponsor is the principal point of contact for the change and is responsible for overseeing the passage of the change through the process. The HRH Change Sponsor will propose a categorization of the proposed change. This categorization will be a reflection of the complexity or significance of the change and drive the level of assessment/assurance to be applied to its consideration.

**Table 12. Change Categorization for Safety**
^ Type of Change ^ Level 0\\ (No Safety Impact) ^ Level 1\\ (Minor Safety Impact) ^ Level 2\\ (Major Safety Impact) ^

==== 4.8 Emergency Management Program ====
The following sections provide further details on how the City’s  Emergency Management Plan and the HRH Emergency Management Plan provides emergency preparedness and management for the HRTP.

\\
=== 4.8.1 Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan ===
The City and County of Honolulu maintains a Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP).  The CEMP will be updated to incorporate the rail transit system.  The City’s plan includes procedures for natural as well as manmade disasters such as hurricanes, tsunamis, earthquakes, pandemics, terrorist attack, bomb threats, etc. The plan also identifies essential employees and lists the responsibilities and obligations for each. The DTS CSSO is responsible for coordinating rail-related drills and simulations that test the CEMP.

The DTS CSSO is responsible for coordinating and planning emergency response with external agencies such as the Honolulu Fire Department, the Honolulu Police Department, Honolulu Emergency Medical Services, and the Honolulu Department of Emergency Management. The Honolulu Department of Emergency Management’s Director of Marketing and Communications is responsible for coordinating all communications with the Media and also the development, implementation, and reviewing of Media Relations guidelines.

\\
=== 4.8.2 HRH Emergency Management Plan ===
The HRH Emergency Management Plan (EMP) includes the emergency management concerning all incidents or accidents on or affecting HRTP infrastructure or premises. The EMP is intended to prevent and mitigate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from emergencies. These activities are aligned to but separate from crisis management activities. All management, employees, contractors, and other individuals working for or on HRH controlled infrastructure shall comply with the EMP and procedures to ensure that emergencies are managed appropriately and swiftly with the impact of the emergency minimized to the greatest extent possible. 

HRH is committed to the environment, health and safety of its employees, contractors, customers, the public, and all who are affected by its operations. Implementation of sound emergency management procedures and principles are fundamental to achieving this commitment. Refer to [[hsqe:emergency-management:procedure:hnl-09007-emergency-management-plan|HNL-09007]] Emergency Management Plan for further details on emergency management of the HRTP system.
The EMP defines the strategic framework and references the standard processes for managing the response to operational emergencies. 

The key elements to emergency management described in the HNL-09007: Emergency Management Plan are:

  * Prevention and mitigation (identifying, assessing, and managing risk),

  * Emergency preparedness (preparing plans, training, setting up communication networks, identifying roles and responsibilities, call out rosters, exercise, and drills),

  * Emergency response (systematic and organized approach to responding to an emergency, including allocation of resources and external agency interaction, where applicable), and

  * Recovery and service restoration (getting the business back to normal, post incident review, lessons learned, returning to normal operations).

\\
===== 5 SMS Component 3 - Safety Assurance =====
The Safety Assurance component assures that mitigations are implemented, adhered to, appropriate, effective and sufficient in addressing the potential consequences of identified hazards. Mitigations developed under the Safety Risk Management process are monitored if:

1) The mitigations are effective, and 
2) That no new risks have been introduced through implementation of the mitigations. 

Safety Assurance also ensures that the SMS is effective in meeting HRH’s safety objectives and safety performance targets. HRH assures that its safety objectives are met through the collection and analysis of safety data, including the tracking of safety risk mitigations. 

HRH implements its Safety Assurance process through the active monitoring of operations, safety reporting systems, routine workplace observations, inspections, audits, and other activities, designed to support safety oversight and performance monitoring.
HRH has established the following Safety Assurance processes:

  * Safety Data Collection and Analysis: Monitor and measure safety performance monitoring and measurement (HNL-09613: Monitoring, Measurement and Reporting Procedure)

  * Rules Compliance: Monitoring for compliance with, and sufficiency of, HRH’s procedures for operations and maintenance 

  * Accident Investigation Procedures: Investigations of safety events to identify causal factors ([[hsqe:safety:procedure:hnl-09023-accident-and-incident-procedure|HNL-09023]] O&M Provider - Accident and Incident Notification, Reporting and Investigation Procedure)

  * Internal Audit Plan: Conducting internal safety audits and reviews (HNL-09616: IMS Audit)

  * Verification within Management of Change: Monitoring operations post change implementation to ensure that the intended outcome has been realized (HNL-09619: Management of Change Procedure and HNL-90705 Asset Configuration Change Control Management Procedure)

\\
==== 5.1 Safety Data Acquisition, Collection, and Analysis ====
The analysis of system specific data can be used to determine trends and patterns in system operation. Used as part of the hazard management process, data collection and analysis can identify hazards before they cause accidents by such techniques as trend analysis. Safety data collection and analysis is a vital component of efforts to improve system safety performance.

HRH has established methodologies for collecting, maintaining, analyzing, and distributing safety data to monitor and measure safety performance in HRH document HNL-09613: Monitoring, Measurement and Reporting Procedure using measurement methods including:

  * Direct Performance Measurement: the measure is directly extracted from an electronic system, compiled according to a specific definition, and checked for consistency with contextual information and identify events beyond the control of the operator

  * Records from a Computerized Maintenance Management System: the measure is the result of a query from a Computerized Maintenance Management System; and

  * Surveys: are either conducted according to a predetermined questionnaire by DTS, an independent surveyor (enquiring openly or as a “mystery shopper”), HRH inspection team or a joint team between DTS and HRH

\\
==== 5.2 Rules Compliance ====
Operation and maintenance rules and procedures will be created and reviewed on a regular basis through established methods to ensure that all safety considerations have been made and the process is documented. Additionally, HRH personnel will be given rules checks to verify that they understand the requirements of their positions. HRH is responsible for monitoring the system for compliance with those policies and procedures for operations and maintenance through:

  * In process and end product checking by supervisors e.g. signing equipment into service and active monitoring of critical pre-cursors such as Safety Critical Communications (see HNL-09639 Safety Critical Communications Procedure)

  * Toolbox talks and informal briefings (See HNL-09607 HSEQ Communications Procedure)

  * Planned General Inspections and Leadership Tours (see HNL-09634 Planned General Inspections and Leadership Tours Procedure)

  * Booking in procedures 

  * Drug and Alcohol Testing (planned and random) (see HNL-09719 Drug and Alcohol Program)

  * ‘Management by Walking About’

Rules and procedures will be internally reviewed and audited on an annual basis by the Rules and Procedures Committee. Additional reviews can be started as part of a corrective action plan, management of change, or as identified by employees.

\\
==== 5.3 Safety Related Facility and Equipment Inspections and Audits ====
The maintenance regime is broadly separated into two types of maintenance: Preventive and Corrective Maintenance. Preventive maintenance incorporates activities which are aimed at minimizing the frequency and ideally eliminating the potential occurrence of events which may affect the overall System Availability and Reliability. Corrective maintenance incorporates activities which are primarily aimed at rectifying issues or faults which may lead to, or currently are, affecting the System Availability and Reliability.
Safety-related facilities and equipment subject to the maintenance program include but are not limited to: 

  * Rolling Stock (including MOW and maintenance vehicles, e.g., train exterior, train interior, emergency drive consoles, etc.) 

  * Traction Power Sub-Stations

  * Contact and running rail

  * Power Distribution Systems 

  * ROC and Stations and all related equipment (platform screen gates, fare vending equipment and gates, vehicle lifts, cranes, fall arrest systems, etc.)

  * Guideway

  * Train Control System/ Automatic Train Control (ATC) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)

  * Communications

  * Pre-Service Train Inspections

  * Pre-Service Station Inspections

  * Other office buildings or structures used

Performance of preventive maintenance activities and inspections of facilities is based on the HRH Maintenance Plan and OEM specifications. The Maximo Asset Management software, the Maintenance Management Information System (MMIS) automatically creates appropriate checklists. All maintenance actions and system data will be recorded by the Maximo Asset Management software. This will enable the monitoring of the maintainability, reliability and availability of system and sub-system equipment.

Further detail is contained with HNL-09634: Planned General Inspections and Leadership Tours Procedure, [[station:instruction:hnl-09525-station-inspection|HNL-09525]] Station Inspection Work Instruction, and [[train:instruction:hnl-09529-train-inspection-preparation|HNL-09529]] Train Inspection/Preparation Work Instruction.

Periodic audits will be conducted to assess the proper implementation of the current maintenance program, as determined by HRH Management and Safety personnel.

\\
==== 5.4 Procurement ====
HRH is responsible for establishing procurement procedures to be reviewed and approved by DTS.

Procurement of materials, products, systems, and services for the HRTP in compliance with safety principles and requirements is the responsibility of HRH to support the procurement process.

As a part of the HRH procurement process, Contract Documents issued to potential Contractors will contain the safety principles and requirements. This is in addition to functional, performance and other requirements that apply to various materials, products, systems, and services.

Qualified Contractors’ proposed solutions are evaluated for compliance with safety principles and safety requirements prior to award of contractors.

The procurement controls of spare and replacement parts and O&M materials will be in place to ensure that:

  * Items documented in the Configuration Management and/or Asset Management Databases within the Maximo Asset Management software are procured from approved suppliers for replacement and/or repair of failed items.

  * Consumable materials and supplies, including Hazardous Materials, are procured from approved Suppliers/Vendors in accordance with applicable specifications and proper documentation.

Events that are reportable to HDOT, FTA or NTSB will be reported immediately to the HRH Head of HSEQ. 

External notification is accomplished by either the HRH Head of HSEQ or the DTS CSSO, depending on the event/threshold, who will inform HDOT, FTA and/or the NTSB in the cases and timeframes required. Notification can occur via a method as approved by HDOT. 

  * Accident (2-hour Response):  HRH is responsible for the accident notification process: 2-hour notification to HDOT and FTA for major accidents involving fatality (occurring at the scene or within 30 days following the accident) or one or more persons suffering serious injury. The FTA and NTSB will be notified by a call to the National Response Center (1-800-424-0201). Types of events include:\\ \\ o A collision between a rail transit vehicle and another rail transit vehicle\\ o A collision with a person resulting in serious injury or fatality\\ o A collision with an object resulting in serious injury or fatality\\ o A collision that results in substantial property damage (pursuant to NTD definition)\\ o A runaway train\\ o Evacuation due to life safety reasons\\ o A derailment (mainline or yard)\\ o Fires resulting in a serious injury or fatality

  * Incident (24-hour Response):  DTS will be responsible for the incident notification process: 24-hour notification to HDOT and FTA (NTD) for incidents involving a personal injury that is not a serious injury or one or more injuries requiring medical transportation away from the event. HRH will notify DTS of such events to facilitate this reporting. Types of events include:\\ \\ o Evacuation of a train into the right-of-way or onto adjacent track; or customer self-evacuation\\ o Certain low-speed collisions involving a rail transit vehicle that result in a non-serious injury or property damage\\ o Damage to third rail equipment that disrupts transit operations\\ o Fire that result in a non-serious injury or property damage\\ o A train stopping due to an obstruction in the tracks/”hard stops”\\ o Most hazardous material spills

  * Occurrence: HRH will be responsible for recording and maintaining occurrence data for near miss events where no personal injuries had occurred. DTS will be responsible for providing occurrences data to HDOT and/or FTA when requested for their review. Types of events include:\\ \\ o Close Call/Near Misses\\ \\ - Safety rule violations - Violations of safety policies\\ - Damage to third-rail equipment that do not disrupt operations\\ - Vandalism or theft

\\
=== 5.5.3 Accident / Incident Investigation Procedures ===
HRH will be responsible for conducting accident/incident investigations. The HRH accident/incident investigation procedures is contained in [[hsqe:safety:procedure:hnl-09023-accident-and-incident-procedure|HNL-09023]] O&M Provider - Accident and Incident Notification, Reporting and Investigation Procedure. 

A preliminary report will be completed within 48 hours after the accident/incident. A final accident report, including all root causes and corrective action plans, will be done in a format approved by HDOT and submitted within 30 days of the accident/incident.

Corrective action plan(s) will be attached. The Head of HSEQ will be responsible for tracking and reporting the implementation of corrective actions.

\\
=== 5.5.4 Coordination with HDOT ===
The DTS CSSO will be the point of contact to HDOT for accident/incident issues. All materials (audio/video files and relevant logs) that may be useful for investigation purposes and any other items relevant for clarification are to be provided.

If HDOT designates DTS to lead investigations on its behalf (for incidents meeting and/or exceeding thresholds specified in applicable norms), HRH will provide a detailed report for review and approval by the DTS CSSO, and corrective action plans and investigation reports will be prepared by DTS as required.

\\
==== 5.6 National Transit Database (NTD) Reporting Procedures ====
DTS is responsible for reporting to the FTA’s National Transit Database (NTD) per the requirements set forth in Title 49 U.S.C. Section 5335. DTS has an existing agency profile as an Urban Reporter and currently provides NTD reports to the FTA for its non-rail transit services.  

HRH will be responsible for collecting transit-related safety data, as required, and will provide monthly reports to the DTS CEO Delegate. The DTS CEO Delegate will be responsible for submitting all of the required monthly and annual NTD reports. 

In the event of an incident which meets a Major Event reportable threshold, HRH is required to report to the DTS CEO Delegate within 24 hours. The DTS CEO Delegate will be responsible for submitting the Major Event Report no later than 30 days after the date of the event.

\\
==== 5.7 Safety Performance Targets ====
DTS is required to establish safety performance targets to address the following four categories of safety performance measures as identified in the FTA’s National Public Transportation Safety Plan: 

  * Fatalities: Total number of fatalities reported to NTD and rate per total vehicle revenue miles (VRM)

  * Injuries: Total number of injuries reported to NTD and rate per total VRM

  * Safety Events: Total number of safety events reported to NTD and rate per total VRM

  * System Reliability: Mean distance between major mechanical failures

As shown below, DTS has established the following annual safety performance targets based on the safety performance measures established under the National Public Transportation Safety Plan. Aspirational safety performance targets, including zero fatalities, will be set for initial operations. If these safety performance targets are deemed unrealistic after the first year of operations and/or based on a five-year trend, the targets will be readjusted to be more realistic. The total VRM calculation was based on the HRH System Operations Plan (HNL-09006) which estimates annual VRM at 388,362 miles.

**Table 13. Annual Safety Performance Targets**
^  Fatalities (total) ^ Fatalities (per 100k VRM ^ Injuries (total) ^ Injuries (per 100k VRM) ^ Safety Events (total) ^ Safety Events (per 100k VRM) ^ System Reliability (VRM/failures) ^
| 0 | 0 | 4 | 1.03 | 7 | 1.80 | 75,000 |

\\
==== 5.8 Internal Safety Reviews ====
The audit process described in this section is used to ensure that planned and scheduled internal safety reviews are performed to evaluate compliance with the OMSP. Further detail is provided in HNL-09616 IMS Audit.

===== 6 SMS Component 4 - Safety Promotion =====
Safety Promotion provides visibility of executive management’s commitment to safety and fosters improved safety performance by increasing safety awareness through safety communication and training. Through communication of lessons learned and broader safety information, employees and contractors are made aware of safety priorities and safety concerns at both the organizational level and as they relate to their own duties and responsibilities.

HRH have established and perform the following:

  * Comprehensive Safety Training Program - Comprehensive safety training program for all employees and contractors directly responsible for safety.

  * Safety Communication - Communicating safety performance throughout the organization.

\\
==== 6.1 Training and Qualification ====
One of the key elements of safety promotion is to implement an effective training program which will help ensure that staff are best prepared to safely operate and maintain the system. The process of building and maintaining up-to-date training programs is based on:

  * Identifying required competencies

  * Training material requirements

  * Testing Requirements

  * Evaluation of performed training (passing level, satisfaction etc.)

  * Re-training requirements

  * Documentation

  * Requirements for certifications.

HRH has prepared a comprehensive training and qualification program plan HNL-09028: O&M Training Program Plan, for employee training and qualification requirements.

HRH develops and maintains the basic training programs for OCC Operators, Station Operators, Technicians and Administrative and Management personnel. The training program includes both an initial training program for new employees, and an annual re-training program to maintain competency of staff on revised procedures.

HRH will determine the necessary passing scores and requirements for personnel in the various positions to maintain their certifications, along with the requirements of the trainers.

Roadway Worker Protection Training must be given to all any HRH personnel prior to working on or around the right-of-way.

\\
=== 6.1.1 HRH Employee Safety ===
New employees will receive basic health and safety training prior to receiving the in-depth system specific training courses developed in partnership between HRH and the D&B Contractor applicable to the particular job function. Once assigned to a work location, location specific safety training (emergency arrangements etc.) will be provided

\\
=== 6.1.2 Outside Contractor Safety ===
HRH will provide familiarization training for outside contractors and to the City’s fire, safety, and security personnel and others entering the System. Roadway Worker Protection Training must be given to all contractor’s personnel prior to working on or around the right-of-way.

\\

During the entire lifecycle of the system all information related to training will be stored and managed by the HRH Training Department. The department will be responsible for the development and updating of safety related training courses, other courses, training materials and examination material and records. Such records will be available for DTS to audit when requested.

\\
=== 6.1.4 Compliance with Training Requirement ===
A testing program will be implemented by HRH to personnel for proficiency within their job classification. Training will be completed via written and practical tests to assess a trainee’s competence and capabilities and will include written cases or scenarios. Assessment will form a primary basis for the establishment of qualifications and certification of trainees. Personnel must pass the testing program appropriate to their positions prior to assuming those positions.

\\
=== 6.1.5 Testing of Operations & Maintenance Personnel ===
HRH personnel will be given operational readiness tests to verify their knowledge of safety-critical responsibilities and proper failure management responses, including spot checks, audits, or programmed training. The results of each test is quantified, and a test score will be recorded and entered in the employee's training record. Where tests indicate a lack of proficiency on the part of the person tested, that person will be provided with additional training and instruction.

\\
==== 6.2 Safety Communications ====
HRH is committed to an environment with open and honest communication, in which employees are encouraged to submit reports relating to safety and hazardous conditions. To support the open communication policy, HRH will maintain the right-to-know program and unsafe and unhealthy condition-reporting program.  In addition, all employees will have:

  * Training on SMS and their role in the hazard management process (e.g., hazard identification and reporting)

  * Training on the risk management program including assigning hazard severity and probability

  * Emergency numbers on their badges to be able to report something if they see something, or they will call 9-1-1 in case of a real emergency.

HRH is responsible for establishing protocols for communicating safety information to all employees throughout the organization. Refer to [[station:instruction:hnl-09607-communications|HNL-09607]] HSEQ Communications Procedure for further details on safety communications procedures.

\\
==== 6.3 Workforce Involvement ====
Having effective processes in place for consultation and workforce involvement on HSEQ matters provides for an organization which is well informed about the issues which it faces and encourages ownership for the management of those issues in all parts of the organization and at all levels. It also ensures that the views of those most affected by the risks and issues present are taken into account and their experiences learned from and taken into account in the continual improvement of the Safety Management System. 

HRH has developed processes for promoting awareness, discussion, and consultation on matters of health, safety welfare and the environment arising from HRH’s activities. Further details are provided in HNL-09652 Workforce Involvement Procedure.

To encourage and facilitate engagement with the workforce on HSEQ matters, Workforce HSEQ Representatives will be identified from each functional group within the organization. The functional groups are: Operations; Maintenance; Facilities Management; and Corporate Services.

The role of a Workforce HSEQ Representative is to communicate the views of the workforce within their area of jurisdiction to the HRH management and assist in the development and promotion of effective HSEQ practices.

Wherever possible, representatives will be nominated and elected by their colleagues on a biennial basis. To enable them to fulfil the role, they will be provided with suitable training and dedicated time away from their normal duties to attend meetings and carry out other relevant tasks.

\\
==== 6.4 Lessons Learned Program ====
HRH will establish a Lessons Learned Program that will be reviewed and approved by DTS.  The lessons learned will include creating and maintaining a list of lessons learned which has significant findings, recommendations, and new insights realized. HRH will evaluate their Lessons Learned Program to identify ad-hoc and as-needed training or familiarization programs to ensure that lessons learned are used for continuous improvement.

All lessons learned will result in either a Preventative or Corrective Action which are managed through the PRC-045 Nonconformity, Corrective Actions, and Improvement Plans procedure.
