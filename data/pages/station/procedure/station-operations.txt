==== 5.1 Back of House and Equipment Rooms ====

All unmanned rooms must be closed and locked at all times. Access to offices, staff accommodation areas or equipment/plant room shall be restricted to staff with the corresponding access right.

To deter improper use of access cards and unauthorized access to station restricted areas, the OCC shall regularly monitor the Access Control and Intrusion Detection system. Persons suspected of abusing the use of access cards shall be intercepted and dealt with according to security policy. Any alarms triggered from system shall be investigated immediately.

Station and Security staff shall be alert of any persons who:

  * Remove properties from the railway

  * Tamper with or cause damage to station equipment/properties

  * Interfere with the normal operation of the station

  * Pose a threat to the safety of staff or passengers.

  * Cause a nuisance to others in the station

  * Bring dangerous articles into the railway

  * Enter non-public areas of the station without authority

  * Conduct themselves in a way which is generally unacceptable to staff or passengers.

Any person found committing any of the above acts shall be challenged, warned or dealt with in accordance with the HRH by-laws or handed over to the Police. Refer to HNL-Security Procedure for more details on station safety and security.

\\

==== 5.2 Access Control ====

The Access Control System (ACS) is provided in stations to control access and detect intrusions to the back of house areas, equipment rooms and work areas.

The ACS system uses contactless smart cards as the access media. Access to a specific restricted area will be granted after the card has passed the validation check by a card reader situated near the point of access.

Authorized maintenance personnel can use the ACS to register, modify or delete the access privileges of smart cards issued to staff and contractors.

The ACS can register use of the contactless smart cards including name of staff, times of usage and the places where the card has been used to gain access.

\\

**Figure 7 - Typical Emergency Facilities <fc:red;bg:yellow>#FIXME# Need Diagram</fc>**

An unauthorized person on Lineside can be identified through the following means:

  * Alerting from an ACS alarm when the platform end door is opened

  * Staff witnessing the incident while on board the train or at a station platform

  * Staff witnessing the incident on one of the CCTV monitors

  * Reporting from other eyewitness (staff or passengers)

In the event that someone has been detected on the track the Train Controller will immediately stop trains and instruct the Engineering and Faults Controller to isolate the traction power in the vicinity. A Train Attendant and/or Station Attendant shall immediately be dispatched to conduct physical search in the vicinity of where the unauthorized person was last seen or detected. Where required, Security Guards (and where possible, Police Officers) can also be summoned to assist Train Attendant and/or Station Attendant in searching, apprehending and removing the trespasser(s) from the scene.

It is important to ensure whether the trespasser is acting alone therefore all those involved in the apprehension of the trespasser must check to ensure that the trespasser is acting alone before calling off the search.

Train service can only be resumed when all unauthorized persons are apprehended and removed from the Lineside. The intruders may ultimately be handed over to the Police and an inspection is of the guideway has been conducted.

If the unauthorized persons cannot be found, train service can only be resumed once the lineside is confirmed “line clear” by one or more sweep trains. <fc:red;bg:yellow>(Reference Work instruction)</fc>

===== 8 Telecommunication & IT System  =====

<fc:red;bg:yellow>#FIXME# what equipment do we intend to give them</fc>

\\

==== 8.1 Radio Equipment ====

The Radio coverage encompasses all station premises and areas up to a distance of 50m outside the station entrances. Trackside coverage is by means of leaky coaxial cables and/or low power conventional antennas to match the topology of the specific location. Radio channels will be allocated to users by discipline to facilitate communication within a defined “talk group”.

While failure of the O&M radio system will not impact on normal train operation and service, the absence of radio communication will cause inconvenience among staff’s daily work as they are heavily relying on using radio system as the primary means of communication. Furthermore, the absence of radio communication will greatly impact degraded and emergency operations, thus any failure of the O&M radio system must be addressed and dealt with immediately.

While OCC Controllers can continue to communicate with Station Attendants using IP telephones, communications between Train Controller/Depot Controller and Train Attendant / Station Attendant will be affected as they are heavily depending on using radio system to communicate with each other during degraded operations.

The Information Controller shall therefore, upon being instructed by the OCC Supervisor, advise all Station Attendants to use IP telephones to communicate with OCC. The Information Controller shall also arrange mobile phones through Customer Service Supervisors for Train Attendants as a substitute for radio. All personnel responsible for train movement shall use mobile phone for the time being.

Hand portable radios can be used as a temporary measure until such time the failure is rectified.

All Communications are to be conducted in line with HNL-09519 Communications

\\

==== 8.2 Telephone System ====

In the event of Telephone Systems failure, the Station Attendant will respond in line with [[station:instruction:hnl-09527-fault-reporting-process|HNL-09527 Fault Reporting Process]].

PA regarding train services (e.g. train arrivals and departures) is triggered automatically by the ATS. The PA system is integrated with the PIS such that similar messages in visual form will be displayed on the PIS simultaneously. All messages broadcast in the station can be monitored in the <fc:red;bg:yellow>SCR’s PA</fc> console.

The PA system allows Information Controller (Information / Security) to make live announcements to a station.

If there is PA failure in the OCC, the Station Attendant shall make local announcements by means of using a megaphone.

All announcement are to be made in line with [[station:instruction:hnl-09564-public-address-system-announcements|HNL-09564 Public Address System Announcements]]

\\

In the event of a CCTV Failure at the station staff are to respond in line with HNL-09434 CCTV Failure.

In the event of CCTV Failure in the OCC the Information Controller shall advise the Station Attendants that the OCC has lost the ability to view the areas thus local supervision and monitoring by Station Attendants shall take immediate effect. If Station Attendant cannot view / monitor CCTV at its own workstation, then Station Attendants and/or Security Guards shall be dispatched to inspect / patrol the area(s) no longer being covered by the CCTV system. Priority should be given to restricted areas within the station.

In the event of a CCTV Failure at the station, the Station Attendant will respond in line with [[station:instruction:hnl-09527-fault-reporting-process|HNL-09527 Fault Reporting Process]].

\\

==== 8.4 Passenger Information System (PIS) ====

The Passenger Information System (PIS) comprises a station local control console and a central control console in OCC, and includes LCD display panels at station entrances, concourses and platforms.

The LCD display panels provide passengers with visual information about train arrival times and destinations. In addition, special messages or ad hoc service information (e.g. service delays, advertising messages) can also be displayed on the panels.

In the event of PIS Failure, the Station Attendant will respond in line with [[station:instruction:hnl-09417-handling-pis-failures|HNL-09417 PIS Failure]] and [[station:instruction:hnl-09527-fault-reporting-process|HNL-09527 Fault Reporting Process]]. Station Attendants will attend the affected area to provide information by means of a megaphone. Staff will also make themselves available and provide directions and information to passengers in leu of the PIS display.

The Information Controller shall consistently communicate with the Station Attendant regarding the “next train information”.

===== 9 Automatic Fare Collection System =====

Station Attendants will be fully conversant with the operations of the AFC System. All staff involvement with the system will be conducted in line with [[station:instruction:hnl-09533-ticket-control|HNL-09533 Ticket Control]]. The AFC system is a comprehensive ticketing system. It also provides a means of access control to the paid area of a station. The equipment includes:

  * Ticket Vending Machines

  * Ticket Gates

Procedures for handling failures of the AFC System are contained in [[station:instruction:hnl-09527-fault-reporting-process|HNL-09527 Fault Reporting Process]] and [[station:instruction:hnl-09407-afc-failures|HNL-09407 AFC Failures]].

\\

==== 9.1 Ticket Vending Machine ====

Honolulu Rapid Transit system has been designed for smart card operation using a closed type fare collection system. The primary method of smart card sale will be in the Metro using the TVM located in the unpaid section of the station concourse.

There are multiple options for purchasing and adding value to a smart card, Figure 8 shows the design of the free standing TVM unit with key features:

The Ticket Vending Machine (TVM) is designed to serve customers without the need of staff involvement. However, Station Attendants will proactively offer assistance to passengers who appear to be unfamiliar with the process of purchasing a ticket with the TVM.

<fc:red;bg:yellow>#FIXME# Need TVM photo/image of the TVMs</fc>

\\
[{{:station:procedure:f09-tvm_design_and_key_features.png?direct&600|Figure 9 - TVM Design and Key Features}}]


Cash collected in TVMs will be conducted by the contractors to the city after the station is closed.

In the event that the TVM is not functional staff will follow [[station:instruction:hnl-09527-fault-reporting-process|HNL-09527 Fault Reporting Process]] and [[station:instruction:hnl-09407-afc-failures|HNL-09407 AFC Failures]].

\\

=== 9.1.1 Gates ===

\\

== 9.1.1.1 Normal Gate ==

The ticket gate provides a means of control of passengers entering or leaving the paid area by checking the validity of tickets used.

By placing a valid ticket close to the validator, the pivoting doors of the gate will open allowing the passenger to pass through.

A concession fare indicator is installed at the back of an entry gate which will illuminate when a person uses a concession fare ticket (i.e. children, senior citizen or handicapped person tickets). Station Attendants will challenge any persons who appear not eligible for enjoying concession fare.

\\

== 9.1.1.2 Wide Gate ==

A wide gate operates in the same way as a normal gate and is reversible. It is primarily designed for use by wheel-chaired passengers or persons with large luggage or a baby carrying cart.

While the use of wide gates is not restricted to any particular group of persons, priority should be given to those in need.

Any gate failures will be managed in line with [[station:instruction:hnl-09527-fault-reporting-process|HNL-09527 Fault Reporting Process]] and [[station:instruction:hnl-09407-afc-failures|HNL-09407 AFC Failures]].

Safety, Warning and Statutory signs give warning, safety instructions and convey rules and regulations in the metro e.g. escalator warning signs, emergency stop plunger sign, prohibition signs, fire extinguisher signs, etc.

Emergency exits are provided with lights and exit signs backed up by the UPS so that even when there is a total power failure, the lights and signs will still illuminate to guide passengers to safely evacuate the station.

===== 12 Crowd Control =====

Overcrowding could occur at the station for several reasons. <fc:red;bg:yellow>**Error! Reference source not found.**</fc> below shows the circumstances that could lead to overcrowding and the locations where it is most likely to occur:

\\

**Table 3 - Circumstances leading to Overcrowding**

^ Circumstances ^ Locations vulnerable to overcrowding ^
| Service disruption | Platform |
| Rush in peak hours | Platform |
| Adverse weather | Entrances |
| Special events (e.g. at the commencement and ending of sporting events) | Concourse, platform |
| Incident/accident | Locations in the vicinity of the incident/accident |
| Closure of an entrance | Other entrances |
| Failure of an escalator | Escalators/stairways |
| Failure of ticket vending machines, entry/exit gates | Concourse |
| Emergency | All passageways to exits, particularly at bottlenecks (e.g. escalators, stairs) |
| Station premises obstructed by vendors, hawkers, itinerant musicians, etc. | Entrances |

Particular attention must be paid to overcrowding at the exit of an escalator as it will block the way of those who are exiting the escalator. This is a potentially dangerous situation as it could result in people pushing or even trampling over each other. Before overcrowding reaches a dangerous situation, the concerned escalator must be stopped and used as a fixed stairway/passageway.

There are ‘two trigger points’ for the Station Attendant to implement crowd control measures. **Error! Reference source not found.** below shows the actions for each level.

\\

**Table 4 - Trigger Points and Actions**

^ Level ^ Circumstances ^ Actions ^
| Level 1 (Standby) | There are signs that overcrowding is likely to happen, but the situation is still tolerable | monitor the situation closely by patrolling the vulnerable areas, observing through CCTV and reporting the situation periodically from surveillance pointshave notices, megaphones and temporary barriers readysummon back-up resources, if required |
| Level 2 (Action) | Crowd is building up and the situation warrants implementation of control measures | regulate passenger HRHclear people from the stationprevent people from entering the station |

The local control plans will be vetted by the Service Manager and approved by the Head of Operations.

\\

==== 12.1 Crowd Counting Techniques ====

Station Attendants will use a combination of technology and surveillance to ensure overcrowding does not occur. Methods include:

  * AFC Entry and Exit Counting – where by an origin/destination matrix is produced and analyzed in the key locations, at the critical times to identify bottlenecks, crowding levels and trends

  * CCTV Surveillance – where the Station Attendants or Information Controller in the OCC views specific CCTV screens where known bottle necks/overcrowding may occur. It is also used to validate the AFC data

  * Crowd Counting Staff – where trained staff check crowding levels at key locations in the system and on trains at certain and times/days to get eyes on information about the situation on the ground

  * <fc:red;bg:yellow>Crowd Counting/Density Technology</fc> – Provision of the Hitachi Human Flow crowd density measurement system used to detect crowd build‐up in key locations. TBD

\\

=== 12.1.1 Crowd Control Equipment ===

Crowd control equipment is a standard station provision. All stations are equipped with the following items which will be used for conducting station crowd control:

  * Barriers (e.g. steel barriers, stands, tapes and ropes that could be used for cordoning off/segregating an area)

  * Temporary notices and signs (with marker pens for writing notices)

  * Stanchions (for posting up notices)

  * Station PA

  * Loud hailers

  * Radios

  * Keys for operating the station entrance roller shutters (lower the entrance roller shutter if station closure is necessary)

Station Attendants will ensure that crowd control equipment is stored in a designated area and within easy access in times of need and execute Crowd Control processes in accordance with [[station:instruction:hnl-09504-crowd-management|HNL-09504 Crowd Management]].


\\
===== 13 Normal Operations =====

\\

==== 13.1 Definition of Normal Operations ====

Normal Operation is defined as the mode in which the line is operated in compliance with the developed timetable, with all required trains in AUTO mode all platforms in service and technical systems and auxiliary equipment working in such a manner that no restrictions are necessary at operational level. Normal Operation is defined as a status of operation which:

  * All equipment and infrastructures are available and functioning properly

  * Trains are operating according to the timetable in Automatic mode on the Main Line and in Depot AUTO Zones

  * Train services are operated within an acceptable variation of the working timetable

  * All trains are running be in a counter clockwise direction, with forward operations on the right side lane of the dual lane guideway

  * Platform Screen Gates (PSG) are operational (in unison with the train doors and interlocked with the train control and signaling system)

\\

=== 13.1.1 Opening and Closing of a Station ===

All stations will be scheduled to open at least 10 minutes prior to the first Revenue Service each day in line with [[station:instruction:hnl-09534-station-opening|HNL-09534 Station Opening]]. Stations will be closed in accordance to the [[station:instruction:hnl-09517-station-closure|HNL-09517 Station Closure]].

\\

=== 13.1.2 Operational Sequence ===

In full-service operations Honolulu Rail Transit will be operated every day of the year, according to the following:

  * The departure of the first train, in both directions, is scheduled at 06:00am (Monday to Friday)

  * The departure of the last train, in both directions, is scheduled to depart the terminus at 8:00pm.

Peak hours “AM” and “PM” periods represent the time periods when the Metro Lines will provide the maximum required capacity. These hours occur on business days (Monday to Friday) only.

Weekends and Holiday periods the Base timetable will run between 08:00am and 06:00pm.

\\

=== 13.1.3 Withdrawing of Trains at Terminus ===

Train service reduction will take place after the peak hours. This means some trains will return to either the MSF after setting down the passengers at Stations. Trains will also be withdrawn at the end of service which will require Station Attendants to attend the platforms to manage the station interface and ensure passengers have let the train prior to any movement to the Depot.

Station Attendants will check train to ensure all persons have left the train prior to it departing for stabling in line with [[occ:instruction:hnl-09563-train-attendant-terminating-trains-at-station|HNL-09563 Terminating Trains at Stations.]]

\\

=== 13.1.4 Shutting Down of Mainline Train Services ===

The line can only be closed after the last passenger train completes its journey.

As the Station Attendants must close the station to the public after the passage of the last passenger train, on-time departure of the last passenger train is therefore critical. As such, the Information Controller must inform the Station Attendant in advance if the Timetable of the last passenger train has been changed.

The Station Attendant will be advised by the Information Controller of the time of the last train through their station. The Station Attendant is to make sure that no passengers remain on the platform and they all board the last passenger train.

\\

=== 13.1.5 Station Housekeeping ===

Station Housekeeping will meet the following requirements in accordance with the <fc:red;bg:yellow>#FIXME# HNL- Stations Cleaning Procedure</fc>.

  * All areas are clean, tidy, well-lit and free of obstruction

===== 14 Degraded Operations =====

\\

==== 14.1 Definition of Degraded Operations ====

Degraded Operation is a situation in which a failure of equipment / infrastructure or an incident has occurred, but operations can still continue, albeit with some restrictions. By definition Degraded Operations do not involve life threatening situations nor result in serious injuries or damage to properties. Degraded operation is likely to affect service delivery on the system, with capacity reduced by irregular headways and/or longer journey times.

Degraded Operation means workarounds or alternative operating modes, which need to be implemented to maintain minimum services during equipment failures or operational incidents. Under Degraded Operation, it is likely that service patterns will be deviated from normal with service adjustments.

The objective of Degraded Operation is to maintain an optimal level of service that can be delivered within the constraints of abnormal situations, either invoked by the system automatically or implemented manually by the operator depending on the extent of perturbation.

\\

=== 14.1.1 Faults Detection and Reporting ===

Faults detection and reporting is to be conducted in accordance with [[station:instruction:hnl-09527-fault-reporting-process|HNL-09527 Fault Reporting Process]] and other related relevant Work Instructions identified throughout this procedure.

\\

=== 14.1.2 Station Equipment Activations ===

Station Equipment activations will be monitored and responded to in line with [[station:instruction:hnl-09559-monitoring-stations|HNL-09559 Monitoring Stations,]] [[occ:instruction:hnl-09338-station-emergency-stop-activation|HNL-09338 Station Emergency Stop Activation]], and [[station:instruction:hnl-09527-fault-reporting-process|HNL-09527 Fault Reporting Process]].

===== 15 Emergency Management =====

Emergency management for HRH will be managed in accordance with the Incident Response Manual and a series of Emergency Response Action Plans (ERAP).

The aim of the Incident Response Manual is to provide a response structure to effectively manage incidents and emergencies should they arise during the operation of the HRH.

The aim of the ERAP is to provide a series of scenarios and actions that staff are trained to ensure emergency preparedness across HRH.

These will be supported by Site Incident Management Plans (SIMPs) where each location on the network will develop and maintain up to date measures to respond to incidents on a local level. These plans include evacuation requirements for staff and passengers, a Local Command Control structure, Details of Wardens and responsibilities of staff and local fire safety equipment specific to the area.

All staff will be trained and emergency drills, desktop activities and reviews of the plans will be conducted regularly to maintain the readiness required of staff to act appropriately in the event of an incident or an emergency.

The following Work Instructions also support station activities during emergency situations:
