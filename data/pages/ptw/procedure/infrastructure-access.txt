===== 1 Introduction =====

\\ 

==== 1.1 Purpose ====

The purpose of this procedure is to ensure that specified planned works (and where required, unplanned works) are assessed and appropriate controls are applied to manage risks and mitigate impact of such risks due to the works on the safety of customers, staff, contractors, and third parties.

This Infrastructure Access Procedure is formed on the basis that a Permit to Work (WBP) will be required to access and conduct works on any HRH infrastructure. It is intended to provide a consistent and structured approach to infrastructure access and the Performance of maintenance work and the works access of third parties across HRH. This is to ensure the asset is reliably available for operational service and able to meet the established safety and Performance targets.

\\ 

==== 1.2 Scope ====

This procedure applies to all maintenance work taking place on HRH premises at any time comprising:

  * Technical cleaning i.e. non-janitorial

  * Any inspections that may create Performance /safety risk in public/non-public areas

  * Preventive maintenance beyond the inspections above

  * Activities where separation of works and passengers cannot be reasonably achieved (through segregation or timing)

  * Work in areas where access is restricted (e.g. lineside, equipment rooms, etc.)

  * Work activity that is subject to Safety Permit and risk assessment (Electrical/Mechanical/Hot Work/Excavation/ confined space / working at height, etc.)

  * Corrective maintenance (including construction defect correction)

  * Overhaul works (Excluding Trains)

  * Enhancement, modification and renewal/replacement works

  * Practical training that comprises of activity that would itself normally require a PTW

  * All works undertaken by contractors who are not selected by HRH

The system only will allow work to start after safe procedures have been defined and all foreseeable hazards have been considered. 

The permit to work (WBP) itself will specify precisely the work to be done and the precautions to be taken ensuring, So Far As Is Reasonably Practicable (SFAIRP), the safe execution of other work activities should be covered by:

  * Integrated Management System covering routine activities (P&I and Competence Assessment derived from Task Analysis, Work Orders generated by CMMS)

  * Management of Contractors procedures covering HSQE Conditions and supervisory arrangements

The above WBP definition requirement refers all work in the rail corridor except for defined maintenance activities conducted in dedicated maintenance are as for those maintenance tasks (e.g., rolling stock maintenance shop, wheel lathe, MoW shop, train wash, etc.) by designated maintenance staff.

===== 3 Infrastructure Access Principles =====

A  WBP process is an indispensable part of the management system. It  ensures that a safe system of work is developed for specified works comprised of appropriate measures to manage the identified risks/hazards.  It ensures that this safe system of work is established by a competent RWIC or PIC to manage the safety of a workgroup within a worksite and that others are not unduly affected by the acts or omissions of this workgroup. 

The WBP process will achieve this in all WBP scenarios by ensuring:

  * Work activities are planned and coordinated to avoid unplanned and unwanted events that may affect safety and system Performance

  * All risks are avoided or mitigated by using suitable controls

  * Arrangements are clearly communicated to all concerned parties to mitigate any detrimental impacts

  * Common resources may be shared to maximize efficiency and effectiveness e.g. passenger trains/ OTE’s utilized to support multiple worksites

The safe performance of works across the three stage WBP system (pre-application planning, approval and coordination and implementation onsite) can only be achieved by all the WBP Responsible Parties working together to consistently plan, approve, perform and complete the range of engineering, maintenance and third party works. 
This prescriptive planning process is intended to ensure there are “no surprises on the day” with the implementation of the WBP provisions for the actual Performance of works onsite.

The Yard is divided into several defined areas. Note: refer to Yard Operations Procedure as well for this section.

\\ 

**Table 1. Classification of Maintenance and Storage Facility Areas**

| A | Those areas within the Maintenance and Storage Facility (MSF) limits that fall outside of train Operations and Maintenance activities e.g. the OSB administrative buildings, car park areas, MSF TPSS etc. |
| B | Those areas that are dedicated maintenance facilitates e.g. the OSB Shop, MoW Building, Wheel Lathe. |
| C | Automatic areas - Storage Tracks and Train Washing Facility, Transition Platform, crossover tracks, Ready Layover Tracks and Test Track. |
| D | Manual areas – Tracks M1 and M2 and the Maintenance of Way (MOW) Tracks (OTE movements only). |

\\ 

\\ 

===== 6 WBP Application Planning =====

\\ 

==== 6.1 WBP Application Requirement ====

Minor custodial activities in the OSB will not require a WBP. This will be defined in the MMIS based on the nature and location. The Performance and Planning Manager will determine if a WBP is not required. This will depend on the type of access and/or work to be undertaken. Maintenance activities carried out in maintenance workshops (eg. MoW building and the OSB Shop) designed for such maintenance tasks with an applicable Procedure and JHA will not require a WBP. 

All WBP Application requests for works on HRTP will require approval Performance and Planning Manager. It is the responsibility of the WBP Requester to complete the WBP Application Form in full and formally submit the completed WBP Application to the Performance and Planning Department via the MMIS. 

A WBP Application must include a description of the works and Risk Assessment for non-routine activities where a JHA has not been completed, plus any other approvals, such as an MoT approval for viaduct inspection and any necessary Safety Permits.
 
Application timescales for WBPs should be made one week in advance of the Work Block/Track Allocation Meeting. Urgent WBP application are covered in section 7.3 of this procedure

\\ 

==== 7.2.2 Timescales for WBP Application ====

All WBP Applications must be submitted to the Performance and Planning Manager at least one (1) week prior to the requested work start date.


\\ 


==== 7.2.3 Review of WBP application by Performance and Planning Manager ====

The Performance and Planning Manager must satisfy themselves that the WBP Application submitted by the Requester meets the standard required by HRH and demonstrates the application of appropriate controls to manage risks and mitigate impact of such risks to the safety of customers, staff, contractors, third parties and property due to the works. 

The Performance and Planning Manager shall check the WBP Application Form as completed by the Requester and that all details are completed correctly and are applicable to the duration of the works, AHA/JHA, location of works, and worksite protection required to ensure a safe system of work. 

The Performance and Planning must review the information provided by the Requester and either approve the WBP or return it to the Requester with the reasons for rejection. An incomplete application will result in the rejection of the WBP Application.
As part of a safety review of the WBP, the Performance and Planning Manager should consider hazards associated with the WBP such as: 

  * The operation of On-Track Equipment (OTE).

  * Temporary structures to be employed.

  * Safety being reliant on several stakeholders working together.

  * Electrical works, mechanical works, excavations, hot works.


\\ 

==== 7.2.3.1 Operational Assessment ====

The WBP Application should be reviewed by the Performance and Planning Manager considering the other known works to ensure that: 

  * The risk to HRH Operations of implementing the WBP in conjunction with other known works is acceptable, and if not: apply conditions to the WBP to reduce the operational risk associated with implementing the WBP to an acceptable level. 


\\ 

==== 7.2.3.2 Standard conditions to manage operational risk ====

There are two standard conditions that will apply to WBP applications: 

  * Physical works in public areas during operational hours are prohibited, unless these have been assessed by Operations and the limit of works has been agreed upon.

  * All access to HRH premises must be via a member of HRH staff acting as the Site Controller (or their representative) who will deny access if required.

If the Performance and Planning Manager is concerned that there is an impact on HRH operations that will not be adequately managed by the application of these standing conditions, the advice of the relevant Department Heads, or their nominated representatives, of the Operations Department shall be sought. 

Operational Risk can include the following:

  * Potential for overrunning time allotted for the ETO.

  * Potential for work to be conducted incorrectly, leaving the operational functionality of the system vulnerable. 

Where safety and operational risks are identified, firstly the appropriate controls must be identified and specified to manage the risk, and the WBPs shall be highlighted for discussion during the Weekly Work Block Allocation Meeting. 

\\ 

==== 7.2.3.3 Additional Asset Area Reviews ====

Before completing the approval section of WBP Application form the Performance and Planning Manger shall be satisfied that there will be no impact on any asset areas outside the limits of the WBP. If they believe that there is a possible impact or where they have any doubt, a suitably qualified person in Operations or Maintenance Departments should be consulted and a record kept of the consultation and subsequent outcome. As appropriate, the Performance and Planning Manager will liaise with other departments within HRH to ensure that the impacts of the proposed work are managed.

\\ 

==== 7.2.3.4 Safety Review ====

Before completing the approval section of WBP Application Form, the Performance and Planning Manager shall be satisfied that all safety impacts have been considered and addressed.
The HSQE Department will then conduct a Safety Review and approved or reject the WBP and record the subsequent outcome on the WBP Review form. The Safety Review shall consider the submitted documentation specific to Safety Permits and AHAs.

\\ 

==== 7.2.3.5 Operational Review ====

Before completing the approval section of WBP Application Form, the Performance and Planning Manager shall be satisfied there will be no additional Operational impacts. If there is possible impact on Operations, or where any doubt exists, the OCC Manager and the Head of Operations are to be consulted.

\\ 

==== 7.2.3.6 Work Block Closure Criteria ====

As part of their review, the Performance and Planning Manager should check Work Block closure arrangements proposed and ensure they are acceptable (e.g., speed restrictions). The advice of Head of Maintenance and/or the Asset and Engineering Manager is to be sought if there is any doubt.

Where WBP works are intrusive and could affect the integrity of the asset and undermine safety and/or operational Performance, then work completion criteria should be set so that specific end product checks are conducted by an appropriately competent person before the assets are handed back into service. This requirement is to satisfy the Head of Maintenance/Asset and Engineering Manager that the system(s) affected by the WBP works are fit for use before they allow them to be put back into operational service. 

At the completion of the works the RWIC or PIC are to identify and ensure that the asset is fit for service as part of closing the Work Order in the MMIS. Any restrictions on the asset are to be communicated to the OCC via the radio and as a notation on the closed Work Order. The OCC is then required to reflect a restriction in the ATS/ATC, the TCO Log and issue an Operations Bulletin.

\\ 

==== 7.2.3.7 Need for Exclusive Access Outside the Roadway ====

As part of the consideration of the WBP Application, the Performance and Planning Manager must determine whether the assessment indicates the need to provide exclusive access to areas outside the Roadway to enable works to proceed safely and with consideration to the operation of the railway. This determination must consider the following:


  * **Can exclusive access be given at requested time?** A decision shall be taken whether exclusive access can be given at the time requested. This decision will be made based on whether it conflicts with other works and whether these other works are of a higher priority than the works requiring exclusive access
  * **Exclusive access works are of higher priority?** If the works are of higher priority than other known works, they should be planned into the schedule and any other competing works rearranged by offering the Operations Experts alternative times to work at that location where the exclusive access works will be permitted. 
  * **Exclusive access works are of lower priority** If the works are of lower priority than other known works, the other known works should be planned into the schedule at their requested time and the exclusive access rearranged by offering the Operations Experts alternative times to work at that location.

If the works will require exclusive access, they shall be confined to a specific date and time and noted in the General Order.

\\ 

==== 7.2.4 Weekly Work Block Allocation Meeting ====
