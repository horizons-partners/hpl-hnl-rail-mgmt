===== 1 Introduction =====

\\ 

==== 1.1 Purpose ====

The purpose of this procedure is to ensure that specified planned works (and where required, unplanned works) are assessed and appropriate controls are applied to manage risks and mitigate impact of such risks due to the works on the safety of customers, staff, contractors, and third parties.

This Infrastructure Access Procedure is formed on the basis that a Permit to Work (PTW) will be required to access and conduct works on any HRH infrastructure. It is intended to provide a consistent and structured approach to infrastructure access and the performance of maintenance work and the works access of third parties across HRH. This is to ensure the asset is reliably available for operational service and able to meet the established safety and Performance targets.

\\ 

==== 1.2 Scope ====

This procedure applies to all maintenance work taking place on HRH premises at any time comprising:

  * Technical cleaning i.e. non-janitorial

  * Any inspections that may create Performance /safety risk in public/non-public areas

  * Preventive maintenance beyond the inspections above

  * Activities where separation of works and passengers cannot be reasonably achieved (through segregation or timing)

  * Work in areas where access is restricted (e.g. lineside, equipment rooms, etc.)

  * Work activity that is subject to Safety Permit and risk assessment (Electrical/Mechanical/Hot Work/Excavation/ confined space / working at height, etc.)

  * Corrective maintenance (including construction defect correction)

  * Overhaul works (Excluding Trains)

  * Enhancement, modification and renewal/replacement works

  * Practical training that comprises of activity that would itself normally require a PTW

  * All works undertaken by contractors who are not selected by HRH

The system will only allow work to start only after safe procedures have been defined and all foreseeable hazards have been considered.

The PTW itself will specify precisely the work to be done and the precautions to be taken ensuring, So Far As Is Reasonably Practicable (SFAIRP) the safe execution of other work activities should be covered by:

  * Integrated Management System covering routine activities (P&I and Competence Assessment derived from Task Analysis, Work Orders generated by CMMS)

  * Management of Contractors procedures covering HSQE Conditions and supervisory arrangements

The above PTW definition requirement refers to restricted areas which includes equipment rooms, below are the rooms identified:

1) Signaling / Communications Room

2) Traction Power Substation

3) Primary Cabinet Room

4) Brake Resister Unit

5) Uninterrupted Power Supply

\\

\\ 

===== 3 Infrastructure Access Principles =====

A Permit to Work (PTW) process is an indispensable part of the management system which ensures that a safe system of work is developed for specified works comprising of appropriate measures to manage the identified risks/hazards and that this safe system of work is established by a competent On Site Coordinator OSC(OSC) to manage the safety of a workgroup working within a worksite and that others are not unduly affected by the acts or omissions of this workgroup.

The PTW process will achieve this in all PTW scenarios by ensuring:

  * Work activities are planned and coordinated to avoid unplanned and unwanted events that may affect safety and system Performance

  * All risks are avoided or mitigated by using suitable controls

  * Arrangements are clearly communicated to all concerned parties to mitigate any detrimental impacts

  * Common resources may be shared to maximize efficiency and effectiveness e.g. passenger trains/ OTE’s utilized to support multiple worksites

The safe Performance of works across the three stage PTW system (pre-application planning, approval and coordination and implementation on site) can only be achieved by all the PTW Responsible Parties working together to consistently plan, approve, perform and complete the range of engineering, maintenance and third party works.

This prescriptive planning process is to ensure there are ‘no surprises on the day’ with the implementation of the PTW provisions for the actual Performance of works onsite.

<alert type="success">
The default language for all aspects of the PTW procedure is English and this requirement shall extend to verbal communications, written communications and instructions including all training and technical material provided

[{{ :ptw:procedure:hnl-09663-f02.png?direct |Figure 2. Application of the PTW Procedure}}]

\\

\\ 

===== 5 Yard Environment =====

\\ 

==== 5.1 Classification of Yard Areas ====

The Yard is divided into several defined areas. Note: refer to Yard Operations Procedure as well for this section.

\\ 

**Table 1. Classification of Maintenance and Storage Facility Areas**

| A | Those areas within Yard limits that fall outside of train Operations; for example, administrative buildings, car park areas, etc. |
| B | Area Workshops and maintenance tracks |
| C | Automatic areas for example: Stabling Tracks and Train Washing Facility, Transition Platform, crossover tracks, Ready Layover Tracks and Test Track |
| D | Manual areas – Operations and Service Building (OSB), Maintenance of Way (MOW) Tracks |

\\ 

==== 5.2 Permit to enter ====

Where a person is attending an area for the purpose of non-intrusive activities, they should have received local HRH safety briefing (generic) and hold a HRH Permit to Enter (PTE) for the associated line and Non-lineside area.

Examples of work, which is considered non-intrusive, are as follows:

  * Visual inspections

  * Taking photographs

  * Taking measurements

  * Taking readings

Areas where PTE is not acceptable are as follows:

  * Lineside

  * Critical rooms such as TPSS

  * Yard workshops

The Landlord would then be responsible for ensuring that visitors are controlled on their premises and address locally, any clashes of activity covered by a PTW or PTE.\\

\\ 

==== 6.2 PTE/PTW Application Planning ====

The Operations Experts must determine whether a PTW or PTE is required. This will depend on the type of access and/or work to be undertaken. For non-intrusive, low risk activities where the activities will not affect the HRH infrastructure/assets, the operations of the railways or its Performance, then the PTE would normally be the most suitable. Other works considered intrusive, e.g. installation or maintenance, would require a PTW.

All PTW and PTE Application requests for works on HRH will require approval by a HRH Sponsor. It is the responsibility of the Operations Experts to complete either the PTW Application Form or the PTE Application Form in full and formally submit the completed PTW/PTE Application to the Performance and Planning Manager.

For a PTW Application this must include a Method Statement and Risk Assessment plus any other approvals, such as a #FIXME# No Objection Certificate (NOC), Asset Configuration Change Application (ACCA) and any necessary Safety Permits.

Application timescales for PTWs should be made in accordance with those shown in Table 4.

PTE timescales for approval will be one (01) week from the application to the Operations Experts.

\\ 

==== 6.3 Appointing the HRH Sponsor ====

When a PTE or PTW Application is made, the Performance and Planning Manager must firstly confirm that the Operations Experts is acting on behalf of a company that is approved to undertake work on HRH. If this is not the case, the Operations Experts must be told that the Application cannot be progressed.

If the Application can be progressed, the Performance and Planning Manager must establish the nature of the work involved, to enable a suitably qualified HRH Sponsor to be appointed. The Performance and Planning Manager will firstly decide which of the HRH asset areas the work activity is to be undertaken within:

  * ATC and Communications

  * Civil and Track

  * Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing Systems

  * Rolling Stock and Yards

  * CMMS

  * Stations Department (PTE Sponsor only)

Once the Performance and Planning Manager has established the asset area the name of a suitably qualified HRH Sponsor from the Sponsor list shall be nominated.

Where the Performance and Planning Manager is unsure as to which asset area the work activity falls within, the Performance and Planning Manager should contact the most suitable HRH Sponsor to verify they are best suited. If the proposed HRH Sponsor believes the work activity to be in a different asset area a HRH Sponsor from within that area should be contacted and verified that they are the most suited and then nominated.

If agreement cannot be reached, the Performance and Planning Manager or their designate will make the decision.

Once a HRH Sponsor has been nominated, the Performance and Planning Manager shall forward the PTE/PTW Application to the nominated HRH Sponsor. The Performance and Planning Manager shall notify the Operations Experts the name of the nominated HRH Sponsor.\\

\\ 

===== 7 Permit to Enter Application =====

\\ 

==== 7.1 Completing the Permit to Enter Application ====

If a PTE is required, the Operations Experts should complete parts 1 and 2 of the HNL-09575 Permit to Work Application Form and submit it to the Performance and Planning Manager.

Upon receipt, the Performance and Planning Manager will review and approve the recording of the PTE details by the Operations Experts in the PTE Application Tracking Log, including Operations Experts details, scope of tasks, location; validity dates and allocates a PTE Application Tracking Number.

The PTE application will contain names of individuals who are either:

  * Trained in Lineside or Non-lineside activities (OSC or Worker)

  * Have been briefed with the Non-lineside presentation, and the Operations Experts has submitted the briefing record as part of the PTE Application

The Operations Experts must ensure that the named persons on the PTE Application have received the HRH PTE Induction Brief as minimum; records of this must be available to the HRH Sponsor as the PTE Application approval shall be subject to this mandatory requirement.

\\ 

==== 7.2 Approving the Permit to Enter (PTE) Application/Retail Premises ====

Upon receipt of a PTE Application, the HRH Sponsor will:

  * Review the PTE Application

  * Confirm the activity meets the criteria for PTE. If the HRH Sponsor determines that the activity requires PTW, he must communicate this via e-mail to the Operations Experts keeping the Performance and Planning Manager in copy

When approved, the HRH Sponsor sends copy of the PTE to the Performance and Planning Manager who, upon receipt, must record in the PTE Application Tracking Log the approval details, date, any restrictions and allocates a PTE Number. The Performance and Planning Manager will notify and send the approved PTE Application to the Operations Experts. The maximum validity period of a PTE shall be one (01) month from the approval date. When rejected, the HRH Sponsor must notify the Operations Experts via email (keeping the Performance and Planning Manager in copy) stating the reason of the rejection. The Operations Experts must record the details in the PTE Application Tracking Log. (Electronic).

Landlords (i.e. Station Operators) reserve the right to deny access to parties with an approved PTE to maintain safety and/or enforce operational priorities.

\\ 

==== 7.3 Landlord Controls ====

The Landlord must have the following controls in place to manage access to their premises when granted under a PTE:

  * Landlord must give site specific brief regarding local hazards, incident reporting, fire evacuation and assembly point in the form of a Pre-Work Briefing\\

===== Appendix 1 Safety Permit (SP) System =====

==== 1.1 Scope ====

The Safety Permit System (SPS) positively enforces specific safety precautions for managing risks associated with works within controlled areas and/or works of controlled nature. The SPS is a key element to the PTW system affording a greater level of risk assurance to higher risk activities. The SPS is in place to provide additional controls for the following:

  * SP - Electrical

  * SP – Mechanical

  * SP - Hot Works

  * SP – Confined Spaces

  * SP – Working at Heights

  * SP – Excavation

  * SP - Traffic Management

  * SP – Crane Lift

The Operations Experts responsible for applying to the relevant Safety Permit Authorized Person (SPAP) for the Safety Permit related to their PTW applications. The SPAP shall review the Safety Permit application and provide guidance to the Operations Experts and issue the appropriate safety Permit for the Operations Experts to adhere to during the course of the planning.

\\ 
==== 1.2 Safety Permit Authorised Person (SPAP) ====

SPAP’s for all disciplines are appointed by the Heads of Discipline based on recommendations from the assessing panels formed by responsible maintenance managers. Only appointed Authorized Persons for the specific disciplines are authorized to issue and cancel a Safety Permit for any of the disciplines.

\\ 

==== 1.3 Safety Permit Electrical ====

SP - Electrical is required when working on HRH when working on the following equipment:

  * High voltage electrical equipment.

  * Fixed 750Vdc traction supply equipment, including switchgear, disconnecting switches, conductors and power rails.

\\ 
==== 1.4 Safety Permit Mechanical ====

SP – Mechanical is required on HRH when working on the following equipment:

  * Mechanical equipment where dangerous parts of the equipment or machinery could reasonably be a hazard and require isolation and.

  * Any fixed system with static pressure greater than 5 bar and equipment with a power source greater than 500 watts

\\ 

==== 1.5 Safety Permit Confined Space ====

SP – Confined Space is required on HRH when a worksite:

  * Has limited means of access and egress.

  * Is so enclosed that without adequate dilution ventilation (Forced or natural) there exists a hazardous risk to members of a workgroup due to accumulation of toxic or combustible agents and/or deficiency of air.

\\ 

==== 1.6 Safety Permit Hot Work ====

SP – Hot Work is required for any work that involves open flame, sparks and/or heat sufficient to be carried onto HRH property and cause a fire and/or activate the fire suppression system. This includes activities such as welding, brazing, soldering, grinding, cutting and the general use of blowlamps or hot air guns.

\\ 

==== 1.7 Safety Permit Working at Height ====

SP – Working at Height is required on HRH when an elevated worksite is 6 feet above the ground and where there is an inherent risk of a member of the workgroup falling.

\\ 
 
==== 1.8 Safety Permit Excavation ====

SP – Excavation is required on HRH when works involve displacement of earth, rock, or other material by means of earth moving equipment, pneumatic tools, electric tools or other hand tools. Excavation may include earthworks, trenching, wall shafts, tunneling and underground work that may result in damage to underground services, undermine structural foundation or the uncontrolled earth movement and catastrophic collapse.

\\ 

==== 1.9 Safety Permit Traffic Management ====

SP – Traffic Management is required on HRH when works involve the temporary diversion of road traffic either on Metro property or on public roads. Where traffic management is required on public roads it is expected that additional permissions must be sort from the Local Government Authorities before works commence.

\\ 

==== 1.10 Safety Permit Crane Lift ====

SP - Crane Lift is required on HRH when works involve the use of mechanized crane lift equipment such as fork lift vehicles, truck mounted cranes, engineering vehicle mounted cranes, workshop gantry cranes, workshop hoist lifts and mobile all terrain cranes. A SP – Crane Lift is also required when crane lifting operations on sites adjacent to HRH property may result in loads or equipment damaging Metro assets and or threaten the safe passage of trains within the corridor. When crane lifting is required of HRH property but associated with HRH works, it is expected that additional permissions must be sort from Local Government Authorities before works commence.
