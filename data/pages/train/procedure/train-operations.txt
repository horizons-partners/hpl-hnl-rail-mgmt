The train staff will be able to send/receive calls to OCC/other communication panels, send local Public Address.

<fc:red>Need confirmation on this.</fc>

\\ 

==== 3.3 Train Control and Monitoring System (TCMS) ====

The core of the Train Control and Monitoring System (TCMS) shall include the following distributed items:

  * Central Control Unit (CCU) in each E car - the two CCU units shall be in redundant configuration

  * Local Control Unit (LCU) in each car - in redundant configuration for I/O management

  * Data Base Unit (DBU) in each E car - store the diagnostic information of all onboard subsystems

  * Man Machine Interface (MMI) Monitor - TOD installed in the EDC

This device shall be used during manual emergency operation, for maintenance purpose during troubleshooting in yard area or during test phase. TOD, interconnected to the Ethernet bus, shall be able to display the diagnostic data stored in the DBU and to command basic test and setting of the main subsystems.

The CCU units in car E1 and E2 shall be linked to the two LCUs of car E1 and E2. These mentioned units shall carry out control, adjustment, and diagnostic functions of the whole train, exchanging command and diagnostic data from/to the other subsystems like ATC, Traction, Braking etc.

The below figure shows the TCMS display structure.

\\ 

[{{ :train:procedure:hnl-09666-f19.png?direct&600 |Figure 19 - TCMS/TOD Operating Screen Structure}}]

The above operating screen is used during the manual driver as one of the major screens in the driver mode of the TCMS. In the operating screen body, there are three areas of panels:

1) Analog Panel: it shows the Train ID in the central area and in the remaining areas it contains the most significant analog information displayed by means of analog indicators, e.g. master controller reference (%), speed (mph), etc.

Fault Panel: it shows train system status related information. In particular, it shows the names of the main train systems and if a system name is highlighted, this means a fault has been detected.

Status Panel: it shows train status such as running status, speed limit, service brake status, etc. Every status change is highlighted.

For more details on the train faults and system status, the train driver may go to the Faults and Systems screens through the navigation bar. By pressing the Maintenance screen button and entering an access code, it will lead to the Maintenance Mode mainly used by the maintainer.

\\ 

==== 3.4 On-board Communication Equipment ====

\\ 

=== 3.4.1 CCTV ===

\\ 

[{{ :train:procedure:hnl-09666-f20.png?direct&600 |Figure 20. Onboard CCTV System Diagram}}]

\\ 

From the diagram it can be seen that there are four fixed interior cameras in each railcar allowing for coverage of the entire car. For E car, there are three additional exterior cameras covering the guideway, contact rail and shoe gear for monitoring the train’s operation. These cameras provide unobstructed views of the railcar and live image transmission to the OCC via the Mobile Digital Video Recorder (mDVR) and then the Mobile Data System (MDS).

All cameras are connected to the mDVR onboard. The mDVR is installed in each E-car and can provide digital video storage of up to 14 days of video at 15 frames per second. To provide a degraded mode of operation should one of the mDVRs onboard fails, 2 of the cameras in each car will be distributed to the alternate E-car mDVR.

\\ 

=== 3.4.2 PA / PIDS ===

The Passenger Information System (PIS) system is an integrated system supporting both Public Address (PA) and the Variable message Sign (VMS) systems. It supports simultaneous passenger audio and visual messages at the train cars.

\\ 

[{{ :train:procedure:hnl-09666-f21.png?direct&600 |Figure 21. Speaker Unit (Typical)}}]

The train cars are equipped with external and internal message display signs. External displays are located the non-gangway, front end of the train car while two side displays, one per side, located in the middle area of the train. Four interior display signs are also distributed in the interior of the train cars and mounted transversely from the ceiling in a location to allow all passengers on board the vehicle to have a clear view of at least one of the displays. These interior signs automatically display text messages information of the train arrival and departure to stations, synchronized with audio messages from the passenger address system. These interior displays also display special operational and emergency visual messages as provided by the operator as the need arises.

\\ 

[{{ :train:procedure:hnl-09666-f22.png?direct&600 |Figure 22. External PIS Display}}]

The onboard PIDs and PA system are managed through the same OCC operator console as the rest of the PIS system. An Integrated Communications Control Unit (ICCU) provides the processing and control capabilities of the onboard system devices. The onboard speakers and PIDs are connected directly to the ICCU. The ICCU holds in storage a library of messages typically used for onboard announcements.

Additional ad hoc announcements can be made through the OCC workstation. The ICCU is connected to the OCC through the Mobile Data System (MDS) network providing wireless data transmission along the guideway.

\\ 

=== 3.4.3 Onboard Emergency Telephone ===

Please refer to 3.1.3 Onboard Emergency Call Point (ECP).

\\ 

==== 3.5 Doors ====

\\ 

[{{ :train:procedure:hnl-09666-f23.png?direct&600 |Figure 23.Train Doors}}]

On each railcar there are 3 doors on each side. This vehicle doors are sliding plug type which does open towards the outside direction with an electrical drive unit. The door leaf is almost flush with the outside wall of the car when the door is in closed position. The opening movement does begin with a combination of plug and slide movements, which changes into a pure slide movement until the full door open position is reached.

Doors are close to the current collector shoes and should be used for emergency evacuation only after third rail de-energization has occurred.

Doors are numbered from the Operator’s vantage point in Car E1. Odd numbered doors are on the right (01-23) while even on the left (02-24). Please refer to Figure 4 for illustration of the door numbering and location of crew doors.

\\ 

[{{ :train:procedure:hnl-09666-f24.png?direct&600 |Figure 24. Train Door's Overview}}]

\\ 

=== Door Isolation Device ===

\\ 

[{{ :train:procedure:hnl-09666-f25.png?direct&600 |Figure 25. Door Isolation Device}}]

\\ 

The Door Isolation device allows the operation personnel to remove a door from service, by rotating the shaft clockwise (provided that the door is closed). The out of service lamp should then be lightening up.

==== 3.8 Coupler ====

\\ 

=== 3.8.1 Automatic Coupler ===

\\ 

{{ :train:procedure:hnl-09666-f27.png?direct&600 |Figure 27. Automatic Coupler}}

\\ 

The Automatic Coupler is designed to enable rail vehicles to couple automatically. This coupling is accomplished at low speed without manual assistance and resulting in a rigid, slack free and fully latched connection. In addition, with the designed centering arrangement it allows for both horizontal and vertical track variations.

Automatic coupling of the electrical couplers, that carry the train line electrical requirements, will occur automatically after mechanical coupling has been affected. Uncoupling of the mechanism head can be accomplished either remotely from driver's desk or at the coupler itself using manual release. Once the rail vehicles have moved apart, the couplers are automatically reset and ready to be coupled again.

\\ 

=== 3.8.2 Semi-Permanent Coupler ===

\\ 

[{{ :train:procedure:hnl-09666-f28.png?direct&600 |Figure 28. Semi-Permanent Coupler}}]

\\ 

The tractive and compressive loads are transmitted through the vehicles, through the two semi-permanent coupler halves, to the next car. Coupling and uncoupling between cars is operated manually.

\\ 

==== 3.9 Truck ====

The Metro Honolulu vehicle is composed by four cars E1, M1, M2, E2, and each car is equipped with a couple of motor trucks (i.e. no trailer trucks).

The truck is mainly composed by:

  * Frame

  * Wheelset

  * Primary suspension

  * Secondary suspension

  * Bolster beam

  * Brake

  * Motor

  * Traction rod

  * Pneumatic system

  * Hydraulic system

  * Levelling valve rod

  * Current collector

\\ 

[{{ :train:procedure:hnl-09666-f29.png?direct&600 |Figure 29. Truck}}]

\\ 

The vehicle is equipped with 4 types of truck:

\\ 

[{{ :train:procedure:hnl-09666-f30.png?direct&600 |Figure 30. Truck Types}}]

\\ 

The trucks differ each other according to the presence and position of the following devices:

  * Current return

  * Flange lubricator

  * Axle box

  * DCS Antenna

  * Derailment detector device

\\ 

==== 3.10 Power Collection and Distribution System ====

\\ 

=== 3.10.1 Propulsion System ===

\\ 

[{{ :train:procedure:hnl-09666-f31.png?direct&600 |Figure 31. Schematic of Propulsion System}}]

\\

The vehicle is equipped with 8 motor trucks (E1A1, E1A2, M1A1, M2A2, M2A2, M2A1, E2A2, E2A1). The propulsion system foresees a Traction Converter for each truck (2 converters per car) and supplies the two motors in parallel. The traction converter mainly consists of three inverters legs (one inverter for each phase) feeding two asynchronous traction motors.

The traction converter turns the input DC-link voltage (750 Vdc from third rail) into a variable-voltage/ variable-frequency three-phase voltage, to supply the asynchronous traction motors to manage the traction and the braking. During braking, the converter is able to manage kinetic energy from motors, allowing its line recovery and/or its dissipation on a proper braking resistor.

The two power modules (inverter and chopper) are controlled by the same control unit (TCU –Traction Control Unit), physically integrated inside the same converter. TCU is equipped with a proper interface toward the Central Control Unit (CCU) of the TCMS.

\\ 

=== 3.10.2 Auxiliary Electrical System ===

The Auxiliary System is basically composed by the following Subsystem:

  * Third Rail Collector

  * Auxiliary HV Input (knife switches and fuses)

  * Auxiliary Power Supply (APS) (Auxiliary Inverter) (1 each car)

  * Low Voltage Power Supply (LVPS) (Battery Charger) (1 in car M1, 1 in car M2)

  * Battery (BAT) (1 in car M1, 1 in Car M2)

\\ 

=== Third Rail Collector ===

\\ 

[{{ :train:procedure:hnl-09666-f32.png?direct&600 |Figure 32. Third Rail Collectors at Truck (1)}}]

\\

The third rail collectors collect the 750 Vdc power from third rail. They are mounted on each truck. Each collector includes a protection fuse located near the paddle.

\\ 

=== Knife Switch ===

Each car is equipped with a Knife switch (functional name: 1Q01) that route the high voltage collected from the third rail to the following subsystems:

  * Traction converters

  * APS (Auxiliary Power Supply)

  * LVPS (Low Voltage Power supply) (only in M1 M2 cars)

The knife switch of each car allows to give the power supply to APS and LVPS when the vehicle is into the shop for maintenance operations.

\\ 

[{{ :train:procedure:hnl-09666-f33.png?direct&600 |Figure 33. Knife Switch}}]

\\ 

=== Auxiliary Power Supply ===

APS converts the high voltage DC power to three phase voltage source 230 V AC power. The APS is supplied from the vehicle high voltage power supply system (750 Vdc) through a protection fuse and an insulation knife switch, both external to the converter box.

\\ 

[{{ :train:procedure:hnl-09666-f34.png?direct&600 |Figure 34. Auxiliary Power Supply}}]

\\ 

=== Low Voltage Power Supply ===

The LVPS converter is realized by means of a DC/DC converter. The DC High voltage (750 Vdc) power is supplied via a converter to a transformer. The AC voltage at transformer secondary side is rectified and filtered by means of a rectifier and a filter.

The LVPS is controlled by a microprocessor unit (LVCU) that also realizes the protection against overload and short circuit.

The LVPS is also equipped with a Start-Up Converter who serves the primary function to make possible

the start of the LVPS with vehicle battery completely discharged.

\\ 

[{{ :train:procedure:hnl-09666-f35.png?direct&600 |Figure 35. LVPS Box}}]

\\ 

=== Battery ===

\\ 

[{{ :train:procedure:hnl-09666-f36.png?direct&600 |Figure 36. Battery Box (with cover removed)}}]

\\ 

==== 3.11 Electro-Hydraulic Brake System ====

This friction brake system provides spring applied (passive) service, emergency, and park braking on the two separate Power Trucks (PT). The friction brake system consists of (per car):

  * 1 Electronic Control Unit (ECU)

  * 2 Electro-Hydraulic Units (EHU)

  * 4 calipers

  * 1 Auxiliary Release Unit

\\ 

[{{ :train:procedure:hnl-09666-f37.png?direct&600 |Figure 37. Layout of Brake System Components}}]

The combination of electro-dynamic brakes in coordination with the calipers provide normal blended service braking and slide controlled emergency braking, while the calipers are utilized during emergency braking. The friction brake system provides service braking, emergency braking and parking brake on each truck.

\\ 

==== 3.12 Pneumatic System ====

The pneumatic system of the vehicle consists of:

  * The air supply units (ASU) installed on M1, M2 produce the necessary quantity of compressed air to supply all the vehicle's pneumatically powered systems. This unit includes the motor compressor, filters, driers, etc.

  * Tanks, pipes, cocks, non-return valves, filters, pressure switches and pressure transducers, etc.

  * Users connected to the pneumatic systems as follows:

o Air springs of the secondary suspensions (on each motor bogie and trailer bogie)

o Horn (one on each carbody E)

o Sanding System (all cars)

o Automatic couplers (carbody E)

\\ 

=== 3.12.1 Air Supply Unit ===

The two ASUs are mounted on the middle cars (M1 and M2). They provide air supply to the equipment listed in Section 3.12.

The ASUs and Air Dryers deliver and maintain air supply to the Main Reservoir pipe. The ASUs are supplied with additional components for the protection against the destructive effects of moisture including an air filter, water separator, intercooler/aftercooler, rain hood, and air dryer.

The capacity of a single compressor is sufficient to supply all the pneumatic loads for the air suspension subsystems for four coupled cars.

\\ 

[{{ :train:procedure:hnl-09666-f38.png?direct&600 |Figure 38. Air Supply Unit}}]

\\ 

=== 3.12.2 Suspension ===

Each truck is equipped with dual-independent suspension leveling systems controlling both the right- and left-hand suspension airbags on each truck. A leveling valve maintains the car height a fixed distance from the truck under load conditions, provided the main reservoir is charged and the suspension supply is not cut out.

Air supply for the leveling system for each truck comes from the main reservoir line passing through an air filter and a cut-out cock. The cut-out cock is provided to isolate the leveling system in case of failure or during maintenance operations.

\\ 

[{{ :train:procedure:hnl-09666-f39.png?direct&600 |Figure 39. Secondary Suspension and Leveling Valve}}]

\\ 

=== 3.12.3 Sanding System ===

The sanding unit is a pneumatic sand dosing-and-transport device for sanding systems according the combined overpressure/ejector principle. The sanding device is not equipped with a heating cartridge and has a special valve, which makes it possible to operate the drying and sanding function with different control pressures. With this type, there is only one pipe needed per sanding unit.

\\ 

[{{ :train:procedure:hnl-09666-f40.png?direct&600 |Figure 40. Sanding Unit}}]

\\ 

=== 3.12.4 Horn ===

A pneumatic road horn and an electronic yard horn are mounted on each car. The pneumatic horn is driven by the Magnet Valve (MV) with MRP pressure.

The electronic yard horn is available for yard operating conditions.

\\ 

===== 6 Normal Operations =====

\\ 

==== 6.1 Definition of Normal Operations ====

Normal operations are defined as all relevant equipment and infrastructure provided specifically for Honolulu Metro are working normally as designed and fulfilling the operational requirements with no failure, natural hazard or any other outside failure occurring.

Normal Operations mode has the following features:

  * All trains operating as per the operator’s scheduled timetable in AUTO mode

  * All platforms available and in service

  * All technical systems and auxiliary equipment are working without restrictions as necessary at the required operational level

The Normal Operations mode is termed pinched loop operating mode, where on each line trains operate between the two terminal stations: one at each end of the line. In this mode all trains will operate automatically, stopping and starting at each station with passengers boarding/alighting the train. At the terminus station the train reverses to make the normal run in the opposite direction. All Normal Operations movements shall be in a counter clockwise direction.

The Train Controllers will monitor and supervise the system in normal operations and will intervene in a timely manner if any delays or incidents on the line/station occur.

\\ 

==== 6.2 Principles of Operational Response ====

Main principles of Normal Operational Response include ensuring that:

  * make the safety and comfort of passengers an absolute priority

  * the timetabled headway is respected and corrected where it deviates

  * the punctuality of trains is monitored and corrected where it deviates

  * the train service capacity is commensurate with passenger demands

  * the premises and facilities provided for use of passengers in a safe and good working order

  * preventive maintenance and corrective maintenance activities do not have a direct impact on all of the above

\\ 

==== 6.3 Train’s Driving Modes ====

The Vehicle has three modes of operation plus a “bypass mode”:

  * AUTO Full Driverless Operation

  * ATO/ATP Automatic manned operation assisted by ATP+ATO

  * ATP Manual operation assisted by ATP Operation

  * BYPASS Driver has full responsibility for the operation of the vehicle

When the vehicle is in the ATP mode, an additional mode, Stop and Proceed, is available. The stop and proceed is activated by a push button on the ATC Display located within the EDC.

The unrestricted mode of operation, BYPASS, is not selectable via the Master Controller at the EDC. It requires breaking of a sealed switch.

Please refer to HNL-09530 Train Driving Modes for further information about the driving modes and the switching between them.

\\ 

=== 6.3.1 Auto Mode ===

Driverless Operation permits the vehicle to operate, both in line and in the automatic section of the Yard area, without the requirement of a driver. All car-borne ATP and ATO functions are performed in AUTO mode.

The vehicle follows a route continuously provided by valid control lines establishing a limit of authority of the movement. Control lines are programmed into the Wayside ATP computer and are selected based on conditions of track occupancy, speed restrictions, route locking, and other obstructions ahead of a given train, and are transmitted to the vehicle via AF-902 track circuit.

The route that the vehicle follows is one that is established via the LATS/TWC. It provides the direction of travel along the mainline and through the interlocking. In AUTO mode the vehicle stops and holds at the completion of its route. The vehicle will not move unless it receives valid control lines or a new route. The new route is provided by the LATS/TWC.

During an extended hold, the readiness state signal is set by the LATS. This control line is used to conserve power by shutting down systems on the vehicle during extended shutdown periods. The vehicle remains in driverless mode as long as required.

\\ 

=== 6.3.2 ATO/ATP Mode ===

In Manual ATO+ATP Operation, a driver is present on the vehicle enabling train departure only at each station.

The driver, before leaving a station, closes the train doors by the switch panel on the EDC and allows departure by depressing the Release/Depart push-button on the ATC Display. Then the vehicle automatically traverses the guide way from one station to the next station under ATP+ATO control, performing speed regulation and station stopping as in normal driverless operation.

\\ 

=== 6.3.3 ATP Mode ===

In Manual with ATP Operation, the vehicle is driven by the driver.

The Emergency Drive Console (EDC) contains the ATC Display, Master Controller and other control and indication devices to allow the driver to drive the vehicle manually.

The ATP subsystem controls safe profile generation relative to direction of travel to obstructions and civil speeds, overspeed detection, safe passenger exchange (berthing, doors locking/enabling/disabling), and other miscellaneous emergency response functions (emergency stop, emergency handles, emergency train line detection).

The ATO only supports LATS communications for route indication and scheduling. Speed regulation, station stopping, and all other non-vital functions are the responsibility of the driver.

The driver is given the speed profile that should be followed by the vehicle via the speed profile indicator located on the ATC Display.

In this mode of operation, the train will only be allowed to move in the direction where the Emergency Drive Console is activated.

The driver must depress the Release/Depart push button to allow train departure, as in ATO+ATP mode.

\\ 

=== Stop and Proceed ===

In all vehicles operating in the ATP mode, the driver can initiate the Stop-and-Proceed function by pressing the push-button on the EDP (ATC Display).

Stop-and-Proceed is used to avoid stranding the vehicle due to a loss of valid speed limit data from a track circuit (e.g. track circuit failure). This function vitally limits the vehicle’s true speed so that it does not exceed 10 mph while the speed commands received by the ATP are zero for both line and target speed or no cab present at all.

If the vehicle exceeds 10 mph, SCEB is requested and the vehicle is irrevocably stopped. The SCEB performance is monitored for 2.0 seconds. If the vehicle is still over speed, a request for emergency brakes is initiated by the ATP system. This manner of overspeed control is consistent with the rules for Yard overspeed.

While in the stop-and-proceed mode, the vehicle is continuously searching for the next track circuit frequency. Stop and Proceed mode is maintained until one of the following events occur:

  * a valid speed code (other than 0 mph) is received through the track circuit

  * an overspeed condition occurs

  * the driver pushed the Stop & Proceed Push-button again to finish the movement

  * the ATP fails or loses power

Stop and Proceed must be requested from the active ATC/ATP unit, via the Emergency Drive Console. An indicator light on the ATC Display indicates the ATC/ATP unit has accepted the request.

Note that the vehicle can be operated from either cab regardless of which ATC is active or master. All control/indications are routed based on the active cab, thus providing the appropriate signals to the active ATC.

\\ 

=== 6.3.4 BYPASS Mode ===

If the driver selects the Bypass, the driver has full responsibility for the proper and safe operation of the vehicle.

With the ATP equipment in Bypass, there is no ATP overspeed protection. All vehicle line inputs and outputs on the ATP are isolated. Putting one ATP unit in Bypass forces the other ATC unit to become inactive also. While in this mode, the actual speed of the vehicle is still displayed on the ATC Display.

The passenger vehicle system may limit the train’s speed when in this driving mode.

\\ 

=== 6.3.5 OFF Position ===

The Master Controller located on the EDC allows the selection of Off mode.

From the Vehicle ATC perspective, this mode is very similar to the Bypass condition because, also in this case, ATC is still powered but it is isolated from all its trainline input and outputs.

Finally, the train can also be put in the Power Off condition when it must stop for long periods (heavy maintenance). In such a circumstance the ATC will be completely inoperative and powered off.

\\ 

==== 6.4 Operating Principles of Trains/Vehicles ====

\\ 

=== 6.4.1 General Rules for Train Operations ===

Unless the train staff is under the supervision of a qualified instructor during training, no train staff shall operate any school trains or onboard equipment until they are qualified.

No train staff shall permit unqualified persons to operate any passenger trains / maintenance vehicles or onboard equipment under their charge.

On the Mainline, the default train operating mode of a passenger train is AUTO unless specific instruction has been given by the Train Controller. Any train staff on board a train must inform Train Controller immediately if their train cannot be operated in AUTO mode.

Those who are qualified to operate / maintenance vehicles must operate the maintenance vehicles in the same manner as the passenger trains in BYPASS mode and to obey all lineside signals and marker boards.

Please refer to HNL-09511 General Rules for Train Operations for details of the general rules.

\\ 

=== 6.4.2 Route Knowledge ===

All qualified train staff that operate passenger trains and maintenance vehicles in the Yard and on the Mainline must have sufficient route knowledge including:

  * The location of the Yard and the Stabling Areas, their features, and main facilities. The location and sequence of the stations, their features, and the stopping points of the platforms

  * The locations and features of the Yard reception track and departure track

  * The types and locations of the lineside signals, their aspects, and meanings

  * The types, locations and meanings of the signalling indicators, and markers

  * The locations of the turnouts and their positions

  * The speed restrictions and speed limits at various locations

  * The track profiles, curves, crossings, and the locations of the emergency walkways

The route knowledge and the driving performance of the train staff will be regularly accessed by qualified assessors and examiners at least once per every 6 months. The assessment and the outcomes of the assessment are recorded and filed against each individual train staff as a part of their overall training records.

\\ 

=== 6.4.3 Train Preparations ===

At least once every 24 hours, passenger trains must be inspected and checked before being put into commercial service.

Train preparations shall include checking the train’s interior as well as train’s exterior (even though it could be one side only). **Interior inspections** include the following:

  * Interior Lightings

  * Onboard Safety and Emergency Equipment

  * Interior Temperature adequacy

  * EDC Functional Test

  * EDC Deadman Button Functional Test

  * Windows, Seats, Floor, Handrails and Posts

  * Cleanliness

  * Other checks as when required

Before being launched into service, the train will perform static tests which include braking, doors, and other train subsystems, including TCMS. In the event static tests fail, an alarm will be generated at OCC on the ATS workstation.

Any irregularities and/or defects encountered during the train preparation must be reported to the Yard Controller via radio communication if the train preparation was carried out in the Yard. Otherwise, report the defects encountered to the Train Controller via radio communication for train preparation carried out on the mainline.

Train preparations shall also include the following **exterior inspections**:

  * Exterior Lightings (forward white lighting, red rear lightings, etc.)

  * Car body Cleanliness, Graffiti, Damages

  * Train Doors

  * Other checks as when required

The Yard Controller must be informed when the train is ready for launching into Commercial Service.

Refer to HNL-09529 Train Inspection/Preparation for details.

Whenever a train is coming out from the shop, a Dynamic Departure test on the test track is performed. Successful completion of the Dynamic Departure Test is a condition for the train Handover from maintenance to operations.

\\ 

=== 6.4.4 Line Clearance Operations using Sweep Trains ===

The purpose of Line Clearance Operation is to ensure all tracks on the Main Line are free of hazards and obstructions to train operations. Once the Main Line is verified clear, Commercial Service can commence at once thus the first train for passenger service can be launched.

During Line Clearance Operation, several sweep trains without carrying any passengers can be deployed from different directions and locations covering the whole tracks of the Honolulu Metro. Each sweep train will be assigned with one train staff to either manually drive or stand by at the sweep train under AUTO mode to visually check for obstructions or hazards along the Main Line in order to ensure track safety.

Regardless of the train driving mode during sweep train operation, EDC shall always be ready and the train staff in front of it should at any time be ready to activate the Emergency Pushbutton.

The sweep trains could originate from the Yard along with selective out-stabled trains to optimize the total time taken.

The train staff (Train Operator) on each sweep train shall keep a lookout for any of the following hazards that may affect safe train running:

  * Short-circuiting devices and protective earthing straps left on the Third Rail

  * Persons on or near the track

  * Defective / damaged rails

  * Left over tools and equipment

  * Maintenance materials or objects obstructing the track

  * Switch set at incorrect position

  * Any other infrastructure faults or abnormalities

Should the train staff observe any such hazards, he/she SHALL:

  * Stop the train immediately using the Emergency Pushbutton on the EDC

  * Report the fault/item/obstruction to the Train Controller immediately

  * Follow the instruction of the Train Controller

  * Do NOT go to lineside unless authorized by the Train Controller

  * Where the obstruction, defect or infringement can be safely rectified by the train staff going lineside to clear/move/retrieve the item, the train staff shall follow the instruction of the Train Controller at all times

  * Upon returning to the train, the train staff shall report the actions taken to the Train Controller, who will record the actions in the OCC Logbook, and instruct the train staff to continue with the sweep train run

Train staff shall inform the Train Controller a “Line Clearance Operation Completed” message after the assigned sweep train duty is successfully completed. The Line Clearance Operation is successfully completed when:

  * The train staff will report “Line Clearance Operation Completed” message to the Train Controller

  * Any obstruction, defect or infringement is cleared

Line Clearance Operation procedure is also applicable following a major incident and prior to re-starting of the train service, or after the reopening of a part of the closed line.

In addition to the normal Sweep Trains, a Rust Train is run once a month for ensuring the continuous train detection. During the rust train inspection, the Train Controller must closely monitor the occupancy indication of the train on the track circuity. The rust train inspection should also cover all switches that are not normally used during passenger service.

Refer to HNL-09535 Sweep Train for details.

\\ 

=== 6.4.5 Train Launching into the Main Line ===

Under normal operational circumstances, AUTO trains are automatically launched from the Yard into the Mainline. AUTO trains can also be automatically launched from the Mainline stabling areas. Train launching are carried out automatically because ATS is controlling the launch process based on the settings from the timetable. As a result, Train Controller/Yard Controller does not need to interfere the launching process unless something goes wrong. Launching trains in AUTO mode is always the preferred way.

Under degraded operational circumstances, trains may have to launch manually into the Mainline. In degraded conditions, Yard Controller shall coordinate with Train Controller for moving a train from its stabling location to the Lead Tracks of the Yard. The Yard is connected to the Mainline through the Lead Tracks. Manually driven trains must be handed over from the Yard Controller to the Train Controller so that the movement controls of the train can be transferred smoothly from Yard to the Mainline.

Train staff shall receive instruction from Yard Controller to operate the train to one of the Lead Tracks under BYPASS mode towards the signal specified by the Yard Controller. When stopped in front of a lineside signal, train staff must check:

  * The signal aspect

  * The clearance of the track

  * The position of the turnouts which is in line with the intended movement

Once the train stopped at the specified signal, Yard Controller shall hand over the train to the Train Controller. Train Controller depending on the traffic conditions on the Mainline, shall instruct the train staff to change the operating mode to AUTO.

\\ 

=== 6.4.6 Scheduled Train Withdrawals ===

After peak-hour operations, passenger demands will be reduced, and some trains will be withdrawn back to the Yard. These train withdrawals are planned and will be automatically executed in accordance with the train working timetable.

The ATS DID set for commercial service can identify a round trip or a final/last trip. Therefore, before a train is to terminate its service at a terminal station, onboard announcements will automatically be given to the passengers in advance that the train will be taken out of service and passengers are requested to disembark from the train at the terminal station. The public address announcement will also be repeated when the train has reached the terminal station.

Station staff will assist the train staff to prevent passengers boarding the train which is about to be taken out of service. Station staff will also help in bringing remaining passengers, if any, out of the train. In order to avoid passengers getting into the one car which has been previously checked while the staff is checking the other car, a minimum of two staff (either train or station staff) shall carry out the inspection (one for each car) to ensure all passengers are out of the train.

During this inspection, train staff must also conduct security checks and cleanliness checks inside the train and reports the outcome to Train Controller.

\\ 

=== 6.4.7 Stabling at the Yard Stabling Tracks ===

Most trains will return to the Yard during the end of the Commercial Service Hours for the trains to be cleaned and maintained.

In the Yard, Stabling Tracks S01-08 are fully equipped and are designed to accommodate up to 14 train sets. Additional four train sets can be stabled at the ready-layover tracks, one at the interior-cleaning track, and one at one of the two test tracks.

Each train will be routed back to the correct stabling track berth automatically according to the timetable. If the train is operated by train staff the train staff must follow strictly the Yard Controller’s instruction. Train Staff must perform a final interior inspection of their train and report any irregularities to the Yard Controller.

After observing the automatic train shut down at a designated stabling berth (performed automatically by OCC), train staff shall exit the train using one of the crew doors after receiving permission from OCC. Train staff must observe all the safety requirements when walking in the Yard after exiting their train.

Train staff must return their train driver bag and sign off with the Station and Train Supervisor on duty.

Refer to HNL-09520 Stabling of Trains for details.

\\ 

=== 6.4.8 Out-Stabling Trains at Stations ===

In accordance with the Working Timetables, some trains may stable outside the Yard during the end of the Commercial Service Hours.

To out stable the train, train staff must:

  * Ensure that all passengers have alighted from the train during the last station stop

  * Move the train to the stabling position if it is different from the stopping point after receiving an Authorization To Proceed from Train Controller

  * Inspect the train from one end to another for conducting security checks and cleanliness checks inside the train, and reports the outcome to Train Controller

  * Look out for any items left behind by passengers

  * After observing the automatic shutting down a train at a designated stabling berth (performed automatically by OCC), train staff shall exit the train using one of the crew doors after receiving permission from OCC. Shut down the train in accordance to Train Controller’s instruction, and close the train doors (and where applicable the PSD if berth at station)

  * Return the train bag and hand the lost property found (if any) inside the train to the Station and Train Supervisor before signing off

For details about “Authorization To Proceed”, please refer to HNL-09547 Manual Train Operation.

\\ 

==== 6.5 On-board Customer Services & Duties ====

\\ 

=== 6.5.1 General ===

While on board the train, train staff shall provide passenger service whenever possible. Passenger service duties include:

  * Providing assistance to passengers in general

  * Assisting passengers on activation of on-board emergency equipment

  * Assisting passengers with special accessibility needs

  * Handling passenger inquires or complaints

  * Monitoring the situation and watching for overcrowding or any incidents

  * Assisting on-board crowd control measures as instructed

  * Randomly checking passengers’ tickets to ensure that they have a valid ticket

  * Recording any actions taken and details in the train staff Duty Log

\\ 

=== 6.5.2 On-board Public Address Announcement ===

In some cases where remote public address announcements cannot be made from the OCC, train staff may provide on-board public address announcements using EDC such as:

  * General on-board arrival and departure information to notify passengers which platform the trains are approaching

  * On-board courtesy announcements

  * Informational announcements

  * Emergency announcements

\\ 

=== 6.5.3 Handling Sick or Injured Passengers ===

In the event of passenger sickness or injury on board the train, Information Controller may be informed by a passenger on board the train via the ECP. A Train Operator will be deployed to assess / resolve the problem. When the Train Operator is onboard, the following actions will be taken:

  * Assess and determine if medical emergency services are required

  * Keep other passengers away from the sick or injured passenger

  * Provide assistance to the passenger and delegate volunteers if necessary

  * Obtain details of sickness or injury and passenger contact information

  * Update Information Controller as required and follow instructions

  * Hand over the sick/injured passenger to station staff/ambulance services

  * Confirm to Information Controller once the sick/injured passenger has been handed over

  * Record any actions taken and details in the Train Staff Duty Log

Refer to HNL-09327 Dealing with unwell sick passengers and HNL-09332 Medical Intervention in a Station or Train for details.

\\ 

=== 6.5.4 Crowd Control inside a Stationary Train ===

Crowd Control is necessary to prevent disorder and to preserve passenger and staff safety. During peak operating periods and especially during degraded situations, effective crowd control is the key to successful operations, as passengers may tend to enter onto an already crowded train to avoid waiting.

Train staff shall report any overcrowding or potential overcrowding to the Train Controller. If a Crowd Control Alert is issued by the Train Controller, both train staff and station staff will work together in accordance with approved crowd management plans to ensure passenger safety.

To prevent overcrowding inside a train docked at the station, it is the station staff’s responsibility to:

  * Control the number of passengers on the platform to avoid overloading the train

  * Control passengers boarding the train to avoid passenger overloading

  * Monitor the passenger density on board the train and report to the Train Controller to advise the next station(s)

Train staff when operating a train in manual driving mode will make local train announcements e.g. “Please move further into the car and avoid blocking the doors.”

\\ 

=== 6.5.5 Crowd Control inside a Moving Train ===

Train Controller may request Station Controller to make live public announcement to prevent passengers from boarding the crowded train at the next station. Additional station staff can be deployed at the next station to maintain order and to assist passengers getting off the train.

\\ 

=== 6.5.6 Handling Unattended and Lost Items ===

Lost property found will be temporarily stored in specific cabinets until it is collected by its rightful owner or at least a day. The Train Operator or staff member who finds the item must take responsibility for the item and make sure that it is brought to Customer Service Reception or the designated cabinet mentioned.

Please refer to HNL-09508 Dealing with Unattended and Lost Items for further instructions.

\\ 

===== 7 Degraded Operations =====

\\ 

==== 7.1 Definition of Degraded Operations ====

Degraded Operation is a situation in which a failure of equipment / infrastructure or an incident has occurred, but a part of the operations can continue, but with some operational restrictions. Degraded Operations do not usually involve life threatening situations nor result in serious injuries or damage to properties. Degraded operation is most likely to affect train service delivery on the system, such as temporary train service stoppage, reduced capacity coupled with irregular headways and/or longer journey times.

Degraded Operation means the implementation of temporary fix usually in the form of alternative service patterns, which need to be implemented to maintain maximum services possible (optimal) during equipment failures or operational incidents. Under Degraded Operation, it is likely that service patterns will deviate from normal with service adjustments.

The objective of Degraded Operation is to maintain an optimal level of service that can be delivered within the constraints of abnormal situations, either invoked by the system automatically or implemented manually by the Train Ambassador under the authorization and direction from the Train Controller depending on the extent of abnormality.

\\ 

==== 7.2 Principles of Operational Response ====

During Degraded Operations, the following principles apply:

  * Maintain safety throughout the period of degraded operations

  * Maintain the best passenger service possible under the circumstances

  * Following safety rules, operating procedures, and work instructions to contain the incident and recover the system as soon as practicable

Train staff shall be trained, drilled, and qualified in degraded train operating procedure and relevant work instructions. If a train fault has been discovered, train staff shall:

  * Report to Train Controller (Main Line) / Yard Controller (Yard) and follow instructions

  * Log the incident on the Duty Event Form

While passenger trains are designed with redundancy in mind such that single on-board equipment failures would not have impact on train operations, nevertheless, faults do occur which need to be dealt with in order to restore the operation from degrade to normal as quickly as possible.

Most minor train faults can be resolved via isolating the problem area such as isolating one pair of failed train doors.

To speed up the recovery of train failure, train staff shall be deployed on board the train or at stations for quick access to the defective train. Thus, train staff under the direction of Train Controller shall be responsible for:

  * Identifying and isolating the faulty train equipment on board

  * Driving the train manually during degraded mode of operation

  * Rescuing trains and detraining passengers where necessary

  * Maintaining communication with the OCC throughout

Proper management of degraded mode of operations is essential because of its impact on normal train services and crowd build-up. It is essential to address any incident that results in a degraded mode of operations immediately. Initial response to a degraded service situation is extremely critical during revenue service as the degraded situation may escalate to an emergency.

In the unlikely event that a train is immobilized, in order to minimize the disruption to train services, an immobilized train must be withdrawn to the nearest pocket track on the Main Line or back to Yard for maintenance as soon as practicable, so that normal operation can be resumed. The affected train will therefore need to be either manually driven or be rescued by a healthy (rescue) train through coupling operation and then being pushed/pulled to the final destination.

For this purpose, and subject to the authorization from the OCC, the specific operational response for a train staff may entail:

  * Accessing the failed or incident train

  * Preliminary fault diagnosis, assessment of the impact to safety & operations

  * Fault reporting and handling

  * Local/Temporary isolation of the problem area

  * Manual driving of the train to detrain passengers

  * Auto or manual coupling operation (Rescue Train)

In degraded operations, the utmost importance is that passengers are kept informed about the situation including the extent of time delay and the estimated time of recovery. The OCC Supervisor must ensure that the passengers are informed as quickly as possible about the delays and disruptions. This is achieved by instructing the Station Controller to make the necessary public announcements to keep the passengers on board the train and at stations informed about the situation. Where remote public address announcements cannot be made from the OCC, train staff may provide on-board public address announcements to passengers instead.

The train staff must log incidents or equipment failures in the Duty Event Form. This supports the handover process when a train staff is relieved and ensures that an incoming train staff can provide consistency of support to maintenance with regard to an earlier failure.

\\ 

=== 7.2.1 Accessing the Failed Train ===

Train staff can access a failed train stranded in between stations through the Platform End Gate (PEG) and walk along the emergency walkway or by taking over a passenger train at preceding station platform and drive towards where the failed train is located.

Unauthorized access to the lineside (when the PEG is open) will activate the Track Intrusion Detection System (TIDS) which will result in:

  * Train Movement Authority will be removed on both tracks of the affected station platform area

  * Trains in AUTO and ATO/ATP mode within the affected area will be stopped by emergency brake

  * Trains in AUTO and ATO/ATP mode approaching the area but still within the EB braking curve parameters will stop gradually with full-service brake

  * Alarm will be generated on OCC workstations

  * Video from cameras covering the affected area will be streamed to OCC

  * Trains will be held with extension of dwell time to prevent from entering the affected area.

Therefore, when the Train Controller grants authority to the train staff to access the stranded train from a station, the Train Controller shall command a TIDS bypass for the specific track access.

Train Controller / Yard Controller must ensure a safe path is provided for the train staff to reach the failed train (and back to the station). The safe path ensures that no trains from either direction can infringe the path used by the train staff.

Train Controller must also ensure the failed train will not move suddenly at the same time as the train staff is approaching or accessing the failed train from the lineside. This can be achieved via imposing a work zone covering the area to prevent the failed train from moving suddenly.

Train staff shall follow strictly the instructions from Train Controller / Yard Controller to walk along the safe walking route to reach the failed train. Under no circumstances shall train staff deviates from the safe walking route designated by the Train Controller / Yard Controller.

\\ 

=== 7.2.2 Preliminary Fault Diagnosis ===

Once on board the train, the train staff shall:

  * Make the area safe

  * Report/Update the fault details and hazards to the Train Controller / Yard Controller

  * Record the details of the fault on the Duty Event Form

  * Follow the instructions of the Train Controller / Yard Controller to carry out initial diagnostic, which usually involves activating EDC, exposing the TCMS and conveying indicator readings to Train Controller / Yard Controller, resetting the EMERGENCY BRAKE and/or manually cycling the power/control on/off of the faulty equipment to see if the problem disappears (e.g. sticky train doors). Further instructions from the Train Controller / Yard Controller may entail waiting for the arrival of the maintainer to carry out further diagnostic, isolation and/or where required, replacement of the faulty part (LRU).

At a minimum, the train staff shall be competent to conduct basic diagnostics and operations of the TCMS and EDC.

\\ 

=== 7.2.3 Fault Reporting and Handling ===

The reporting and recording of equipment faults and system failures are essential to maintain a high-quality standard of the Honolulu Metro railway system. This is not only particular for a speedy recovery of a failure or delay but to sustain high performance standards. All Honolulu Metro staff are responsible for reporting any failure, malfunction, damage, faulty or unsafe condition found on the railway systems or equipment at the earliest time.

Failures can be observed and detected during:

  * Operations by OCC, station, yard or train staff, passengers or third parties

  * Operations by system alarms originated from TCMS, EDC, etc.

  * Preventive maintenance by maintenance staff or contractors

Fault reporting is managed centrally in the OCC by the Engineering & Fault Controller. The daily report consolidated by the Maintenance Management Information System (MMIS) will contain a list of faults with relevant details of the fault and its rectification/if it is still failed.

Failures involving transit systems such as rolling stock and signaling will may have potential operational impact to train operations, all faults will be captured by the Engineering & Fault Controllers and captured in the MMIS.

Refer to HNL-09416 Handling Train Failures for details.

\\ 

=== 7.2.4 Local/Temporary Isolation ===

The on-board train staff upon being instructed by the Train Controller may proceed to carry out temporary isolation of the faulty train equipment. Where a train is considered unserviceable, OCC may instruct the train staff to initiate passenger detrainment followed by withdrawing the train from service for maintenance via either manual driving or coupling operation with the use of a healthy (rescue) train.

For example, local/temporary isolation applies to the partial non-opening or non-closing of train doors. The failed train door(s) can be isolated (and locked) mechanically in closed position with the Train Key.

\\ 

=== 7.2.5 Manual Train Operation ===

When it is no longer possible or appropriate for the train to remain in AUTO mode, the Train Controller may initiate manual driving procedure. This manual driving procedure entails dispatching a train staff (Train Operator) on board and operating the train in ATO/ATP or ATP mode driving for failure or incident recovery. This will be carried out in line with HNL-09547 Manual Train Operation.

Refer to HNL-09555 Sounding the Horn on Train for the horn usage under manual driving.

\\ 

==== 7.3 Train Failure Handlings ====

\\ 

=== 7.3.1 General Workflow ===

The general workflow to be followed in the event of train failure and stopped on the mainline is depicted in the HNL-09416 Handling Train Failures.

\\ 

=== 7.3.2 Train Door Failures ===

When failure of a train door is spotted, Train Controller can try to remotely open or close the doors. If the remote attempts fail, a Train Operator will attend the train with the faulty door(s) under instruction of Train Controller. The train staff will check onsite if there is any obstruction that might prevent the door from opening or closing, and then report the result to Train Controller. In case the failure persists, the train staff can isolate the faulty door(s) using the Train Key under instruction of Train Controller.

If there are multiple or even all train doors failing, it is the OCC Supervisor’s decision to remove the faulty train from service.

Please refer to HNL-09425 Handling Train Door Failures for detailed instructions.

\\ 

=== 7.3.3 Rescue Train Operation ===

When a train is immobilized on the mainline, for allowing the train services to continue, an option is to use another train to pull or push the failed train to the next/nearest station and eventually to the yard or to the nearest storage track.

Thus, a rescue train may be required to rescue a failed train (also referred to as the incident train) that has been stranded on the track due to a problem that cannot be rectified on site and or within a reasonable amount of time.

A rescue train is a healthy passenger train that is in passenger service immediately behind or ahead the incident train. If an in-service passenger train is required as a Rescue Train, all passengers must first be de-trained in the nearest available station platform and exit check need to be performed.

The OCC Supervisor shall determine whether a Rescue Train is required and what train rescue technique (pulling or pushing) will be used.

Please refer to the HNL-09329 Train Rescue by Means of Another Train.\\

\\ 

===== 8 Emergency Operations =====

\\ 

==== 8.1 Definition of Emergency Operations ====

Emergency operations is an immediate emergency response to a major incident that causes serious service disruption, injuries, fatalities, or damage to the asset.

Emergency is an unplanned event, which generally, has life threatening or extreme loss implications and requires immediate attention. While all the scenarios of possible emergencies have been considered, emphasis here will be placed on major incidents such as Train Fire, Train Collision and Train Derailment etc., with emphasis on a consistent emergency response such as “train rescue” and “passenger evacuation” across different emergency scenarios.

\\ 

==== 8.2 Management of Emergency Operations ====

Emergency management for Honolulu Metro will be managed in accordance with HNL-09653 Incident Management procedure.

The aim of the Incident Management procedure is to provide a response structure to effectively manage incidents and emergencies should they arise during the operation of the Honolulu Metro, and to provide a series of scenarios and actions that staff are trained to ensure emergency preparedness across metro line.

These will be supported by Site Incident Management Plans (SIMPs) where each location on the network will develop and maintain up to date measures to respond to incidents on a local level. These plans include evacuation requirements for staff and passengers, a Local Command Control structure, Details of Wardens and responsibilities of staff and local fire safety equipment specific to the area.

All staff will be trained and emergency drills, desktop simulation activities and reviews of the plans will be conducted regularly to maintain the readiness required of staff to act appropriately in the event of an incident or an emergency.

Please refer to the HNL-09653 Incident Management for emergency handling details. Where required, specific emergency handlings will be detailed in the remaining section.

\\ 

==== 8.3 Handling Passenger Evacuation from a Train ====

Train staff shall only begin train evacuation when authorization is given by the OCC Supervisor. Trains shall run to the nearest station where passengers can be evacuated onto the station platform. If, however, evacuation must take place in between stations, train staff shall make every effort to safeguard the safety of passengers throughout the evacuation process.

Evacuation of passengers will be required when:

  * a train stopped between stations is unable to move within a 30 minutes period

  * a train stopped between stations is unable to move and the train has no HVAC

  * a train stopped between stations is unable to move and the situations are considered unsafe to passengers

Whenever a train evacuation is completed, a line clear shall be conducted in order to ensure no passengers are left on the lineside before resuming train service. OCC Supervisor shall determine the most appreciate method to evacuate passengers from the failed train and instruct the Train Controller to execute the evacuation method chosen.

Evacuation method to rescue passengers from a train stranded between stations are:

1) end-to-end train evacuation

train-to-train evacuation

lineside evacuation

Please refer to the Train Operations Work Instruction HNL-09331 Train Evacuation for details.

\\ 

=== 8.3.1 End-to-End Train Evacuation ===

End-to-End Train Evacuation involves directing and transferring passengers from a failed train to a rescue train on the same track. The rescue train will stop near (usually behind) the failed train, and passengers will get off the failed train through the door closest to the rescue train. Passengers will be guided to walk along a short distance on the emergency/safety walkway to reach the rescue train.\\

\\ 

[{{ :train:procedure:hnl-09666-f42.jpeg?direct&600 |Figure 42. End-to-End Train Evacuation}}]

\\ 

=== 8.3.2 Train-to-Train Evacuation ===

Train-to-Train Evacuation involves directing and transferring passengers from a failed train to a rescue train on the adjacent track. The rescue train will stop alongside the failed train so that the doors of the two trains are aligned. Passengers will be guided to walk to the rescue train through one of the doors where a portable evacuation bridge is put in place temporary for establishing a pathway between the two trains.

\\ 

[{{ :train:procedure:hnl-09666-f43.jpeg?direct&600 |Figure 43. Train-to-Train Evacuation}}]

\\ 

=== 8.3.3 Lineside Evacuation (Controlled) ===

Lineside Evacuation involves directing passengers from a failed train to the nearest place of safety (for example, station, emergency egress) through walking along the emergency walkway. This method is used when it is not possible to use a rescue train. It is a "controlled" evacuation because the passengers are guided through the evacuation process by train / station staff.

The evacuation process shall entail opening one train door for exit. One staff shall stand on the walkway to prevent passengers going to the wrong direction while the other staff shall lead the passengers walking towards the nearest place of safety using the emergency walkway.

\\ 

[{{ :train:procedure:hnl-09666-f44.jpeg?direct&600 |Figure 44. Lineside Evacuation (Controlled)}}]

\\ 

=== 8.3.4 Lineside Evacuation (Uncontrolled) ===

Uncontrolled Lineside Evacuation is an unplanned evacuation initiated by passengers, either ignoring the warnings from OCC announcement (to stay on the train and wait for staff to arrive) or urgency to leave the train due to unsafe conditions (e.g. fire).

Train Controller shall activate power cut off in the region immediately then arrange station staff to proceed to the failed train, escort, direct and guide the passengers to the nearest place of safety using the emergency walkway. Afterwards, treat and handle the incident in accordance to HNL-09320 Unauthorized person Trackside, to pick up any lost passengers previously unaccounted for.
